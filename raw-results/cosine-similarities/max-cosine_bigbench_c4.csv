As repr(), return a string containing a printable representation of an object, but escape the non-ASCII characters in the string returned by repr() using \x, \u or \U escapes. This generates a string similar to that returned by repr() in Python 2.
Return a Boolean value, i.e. one of True or False. x is converted using the standard truth testing procedure. If x is false or omitted, this returns False; otherwise it returns True. The bool class is a subclass of int (see Numeric Types — int, float, complex). It cannot be subclassed further. Its only instances are False and True (see Boolean Values).
Return a new array of bytes. The bytearray class is a mutable sequence of integers in the range 0 <= x < 256. It has most of the usual methods of mutable sequences, described in Mutable Sequence Types, as well as most methods that the bytes type has, see Bytes and Bytearray Operations.
See also Binary Sequence Types — bytes, bytearray, memoryview and Bytearray Objects.
Bytes objects can also be created with literals, see String and Bytes literals.
See also Binary Sequence Types — bytes, bytearray, memoryview, Bytes, and Bytes and Bytearray Operations.
Return the string representing a character whose Unicode code point is the integer i. For example, chr(97) returns the string 'a'. This is the inverse of ord(). The valid range for the argument is from 0 through 1,114,111 (0x10FFFF in base 16). ValueError will be raised if i is outside that range.
Compile the source into a code or AST object. Code objects can be executed by exec() or eval(). source can either be a normal string, a byte string, or an AST object. Refer to the ast module documentation for information on how to work with AST objects.
Return a complex number with the value real + imag*1j or convert a string or number to a complex number. If the first parameter is a string, it will be interpreted as a complex number and the function must be called without a second parameter. The second parameter can never be a string. Each argument may be any numeric type (including complex). If imag is omitted, it defaults to zero and the constructor serves as a numeric conversion like int and float. If both arguments are omitted, returns 0j.
Here floatnumber is the form of a Python floating-point literal, described in Floating point literals. Case is not significant, so, for example, “inf”, “Inf”, “INFINITY” and “iNfINity” are all acceptable spellings for positive infinity.
A call to format(value, format_spec) is translated to type(value).__format__(value, format_spec) which bypasses the instance dictionary when searching for the value’s __format__() method. A TypeError exception is raised if the method search reaches object and the format_spec is non-empty, or if either the format_spec or the return value are not strings.
Changed in version 3.4: object().__format__(format_spec) raises TypeError if format_spec is not an empty string.
For object’s with custom __hash__() methods, note that hash() truncates the return value based on the bit width of the host machine. See __hash__() for details.
Changed in version 3.4: Changes to pydoc and inspect mean that the reported signatures for callables are now more comprehensive and consistent.
If x is not a Python int object, it has to define an __index__() method that returns an integer.
Return an integer object constructed from a number or string x, or return 0 if no arguments are given. If x is a number, return x.__int__(). For floating point numbers, this truncates towards zero.
If x is not a number or if base is given, then x must be a string, bytes, or bytearray instance representing an integer literal in radix base. Optionally, the literal can be preceded by + or - (with no space in between) and surrounded by whitespace. A base-n literal consists of the digits 0 to n-1, with a to z (or A to Z) having values 10 to 35. The default base is 10. The allowed values are 0 and 2-36. Base-2, -8, and -16 literals can be optionally prefixed with 0b/0B, 0o/0O, or 0x/0X, as with integer literals in code. Base 0 means to interpret exactly as a code literal, so that the actual base is 2, 8, 10, or 16, and so that int('010', 0) is not legal, while int('010') is, as well as int('010', 8).
Changed in version 3.4: If base is not an instance of int and the base object has a base.__index__ method, that method is called to obtain an integer for the base. Previous versions used base.__int__ instead of base.__index__.
Return true if the object argument is an instance of the classinfo argument, or of a (direct, indirect or virtual) subclass thereof. If object is not an object of the given type, the function always returns false. If classinfo is a tuple of type objects (or recursively, other such tuples), return true if object is an instance of any of the types. If classinfo is not a type or tuple of types and such tuples, a TypeError exception is raised.
Rather than being a function, list is actually a mutable sequence type, as documented in Lists and Sequence Types — list, tuple, range.
Return a “memory view” object created from the given argument. See Memory Views for more information.
If one positional argument is provided, it should be an iterable. The smallest item in the iterable is returned. If two or more positional arguments are provided, the smallest of the positional arguments is returned.
Open file and return a corresponding file object. If the file cannot be opened, an OSError is raised.
Python doesn’t depend on the underlying operating system’s notion of text files; all the processing is done by Python itself, and is therefore platform-independent.
'strict' to raise a ValueError exception if there is an encoding error. The default value of None has the same effect.
'ignore' ignores errors. Note that ignoring encoding errors can lead to data loss.
'replace' causes a replacement marker (such as '?') to be inserted where there is malformed data.
'surrogateescape' will represent any incorrect bytes as code points in the Unicode Private Use Area ranging from U+DC80 to U+DCFF. These private code points will then be turned back into the same bytes when the surrogateescape error handler is used when writing data. This is useful for processing files in an unknown encoding.
'xmlcharrefreplace' is only supported when writing to a file. Characters not supported by the encoding are replaced with the appropriate XML character reference &#nnn;.
'backslashreplace' (also only supported when writing) replaces unsupported characters with Python’s backslashed escape sequences.
A custom opener can be used by passing a callable as opener. The underlying file descriptor for the file object is then obtained by calling opener with (file, flags). opener must return an open file descriptor (passing os.open as opener results in functionality similar to passing None).
The type of file object returned by the open() function depends on the mode. When open() is used to open a file in a text mode ('w', 'r', 'wt', 'rt', etc.), it returns a subclass of io.TextIOBase (specifically io.TextIOWrapper). When used to open a file in a binary mode with buffering, the returned class is a subclass of io.BufferedIOBase. The exact class varies: in read binary mode, it returns an io.BufferedReader; in write binary and append binary modes, it returns an io.BufferedWriter, and in read/write mode, it returns an io.BufferedRandom. When buffering is disabled, the raw stream, a subclass of io.RawIOBase, io.FileIO, is returned.
Changed in version 3.3: The opener parameter was added. The 'x' mode was added. IOError used to be raised, it is now an alias of OSError. FileExistsError is now raised if the file opened in exclusive creation mode ('x') already exists.
Deprecated since version 3.4, will be removed in version 4.0: The 'U' mode.
Given a string representing one Unicode character, return an integer representing the Unicode code point of that character. For example, ord('a') returns the integer 97 and ord('\u2020') returns 8224. This is the inverse of chr().
Print objects to the text stream file, separated by sep and followed by end. sep, end and file, if present, must be given as keyword arguments.
The file argument must be an object with a write(string) method; if it is not present or None, sys.stdout will be used. Since printed arguments are converted to text strings, print() cannot be used with binary mode file objects. For these, use file.write(...) instead.
Whether output is buffered is usually determined by file, but if the flush keyword argument is true, the stream is forcibly flushed.
Changed in version 3.3: Added the flush keyword argument.
Rather than being a function, range is actually an immutable sequence type, as documented in Ranges and Sequence Types — list, tuple, range.
Return the floating point value number rounded to ndigits digits after the decimal point. If ndigits is omitted, it defaults to zero. Delegates to number.__round__(ndigits).
For the built-in types supporting round(), values are rounded to the closest multiple of 10 to the power minus ndigits; if two multiples are equally close, rounding is done toward the even choice (so, for example, both round(0.5) and round(-0.5) are 0, and round(1.5) is 2). The return value is an integer if called with one argument, otherwise of the same type as number.
Return a str version of object. See str() for details.
str is the built-in string class. For general information about strings, see Text Sequence Type — str.
Also note that, aside from the zero argument form, super() is not limited to use inside methods. The two argument form specifies the arguments exactly and makes the appropriate references. The zero argument form only works inside a class definition, as the compiler fills in the necessary details to correctly retrieve the class being defined, as well as accessing the current instance for ordinary methods.
Rather than being a function, tuple is actually an immutable sequence type, as documented in Tuples and Sequence Types — list, tuple, range.
With one argument, return the type of an object. The return value is a type object and generally the same object as returned by object.__class__.
Objects such as modules and instances have an updateable __dict__ attribute; however, other objects may have write restrictions on their __dict__ attributes (for example, classes use a dictproxy to prevent direct dictionary updates).
This function is invoked by the import statement. It can be replaced (by importing the builtins module and assigning to builtins.__import__) in order to change semantics of the import statement, but doing so is strongly discouraged as it is usually simpler to use import hooks (see PEP 302) to attain the same goals and does not cause issues with code which assumes the default import implementation is in use. Direct use of __import__() is also discouraged in favor of importlib.import_module().
level specifies whether to use absolute or relative imports. 0 (the default) means only perform absolute imports. Positive values for level indicate the number of parent directories to search relative to the directory of the module calling __import__() (see PEP 328 for the details).
Changed in version 3.3: Negative values for level are no longer supported (which also changes the default value to 0).",ST5,,

Boston doesn’t meow. He trills. Often this pretty sound registers from low to high, suggesting an interrogative. “Where’s the really good food?” Just as often, Boston seemingly trills to himself, especially during play. He’s chasing his tail at the moment — and he caught it this time. Before each pounce, a trill.

Monkey was accepted as well. Is ape another name for monkey or does it have a more specific meaning?
In English, ""monkey"" and ""ape"" are distinct things, but they are often conflated. From what I can tell, ""majom"" can be used for both in Hungarian, but ape seems to be ""emberszabású majom"". This leads me to think that ""majom"" is a more literal hungarian word for ""primate"" (not the religious term), which encompasses monkeys, apes, lemurs, marmosets, etc.
How would you say, ""the apes are very lazy (when they're) in the tree?

Question regarding the word ""lustak/lusta"" in two different sentences. ""Azok a majmok a fan nagyon lustak."" ""A disznok lusta allatok."" Why not use ""lustak"" in both sentences?

""Mi ne ŝatas vojaĝi sola.""
Translation:I don't like traveling alone.
Why is it ""sola"" and not ""sole""?
""Mi ne ŝatas vojaĝi sola"" which should be equivalent to ""Mi sola ne ŝatas vojaĝi"" has to be translated with: ""I'm alone who don't like to travel""
While the correct translation for ""I don't like traveling alone"" should be ""Mi ne ŝatas vojaĝi sole""
A quick answer would be that ""sola"" describes ""mi"".
Thanks for the answer. I already read it in another thread two minutes after. :) Whereas I can't second that interpretation for it's definitely a syntactical adverb. It is dependant on the verb. But I guess languages are always a bit querky, but it's enough for me to know, that ""sole"" is correct, too.
Can you say the same setence while using ""sole"" to modify ""vojagxi""?
Because it's dangerous to go alone!
What's the correct answer? I don't like to travel alone or I don't like traveling alone?? Sorry, I am not a native english speaker, thanks in advance!
Either is fine, as they mean basically the same thing.
I read this as ""I alone don't like to travel."" As in, I'm the only who doesn't like to travel since sola refers back to mi whereas sole would refer to vojagxi if I'm not mistaken.
I misread this as ""I don't like to travel to the sun"".

A:",365049127,0.971643608718869,https://www.animal-ethics.org/argument-species-overlap/,"(1) It is justified to deny full moral consideration to those who lack certain intellectual capacities, or who lack special relationships with others.
(2) Not all humans have certain intellectual capacities or special relationships with others.
(3) It is justified to deny full moral consideration to those humans who lack certain intellectual capacities, or who lack special relationships with others.
If we accept the two premises of the argument, that is (1) and (2), then the conclusion, which is step (3), must be accepted. Step 3 follows logically from 1 and 2. The conclusion of the argument is unavoidable.
We must also note that the second premise in this argument is irrefutable. It’s simply a fact that there are humans who don’t have certain intellectual capacities. Even if most humans have them, it remains that there are many who don’t. Likewise, there are many special relationships that many humans have, such as relationships of love or solidarity. But there are also humans who don’t have these relationships with others. This is the case with many orphans and elderly people, for instance. If the relationships in question are power relationships, there are many people who are enslaved.
All this means that there is only one way in which the conclusion from the argument can be avoided: by giving up the first premise. That is, we have to reject the view that it’s justified to give less consideration to the interests of those who don’t have certain capacities or who don’t have certain special relationships with us or others. But this, obviously, means that we can’t use this argument anymore to discriminate against nonhuman animals.
This argument shows that if one tries to defend the position that humans should be favored over other animals, one can’t do it by claiming that humans are the only ones who satisfy certain conditions, at least if the satisfaction of those conditions is something we can verify. Of course, defenders of anthropocentrism may still want to defend this view by claiming that only humans can satisfy certain conditions in a way that is impossible to verify, but that view will be rebutted by the argument against begging the question.
As a result of this, we face the following choice. We can accept that those who don’t have the aforementioned capacities and relationships should be disregarded or deserve less consideration. This means that nonhumans and many humans will not be fully respected. Or, we can reject that, and claim that in order to be fully respected one simply needs to have interests, that is, one simply needs to be sentient.
The argument also suggests that having intellectual capacities or special relationships are not acceptable conditions as a basis for deserving respect. They are not relevant requirements for it, as the argument from relevance also shows.
The argument from species overlap has often been called “the argument from marginal cases”.4 But this name is misleading and highly inaccurate (not surprisingly, it was a defender of speciesism who coined it).5 The name suggests that the cases in which humans fail to satisfy the aforementioned criteria are marginal ones. But they are not. Those humans who do not have the mentioned capacities or relationships are fully human, not half humans as the term “marginal” suggests. There are many humans in this situation, so their cases can’t be considered marginal in that respect either. It makes much more sense to point out that there is an overlap among different species regarding how they satisfy certain requirements that are often given for being respected, so those requirements can’t be said to be satisfied by all the members of a certain species (i.e., human beings) and only by them.
A related, but distinct argument to the one we just saw is the one we can call the argument from the differences among humans. This argument asserts that if intellectual capacities are relevant to the giving of respect, then we must accept that the amount of respect individuals receive should depend on their intellectual capacities.
Now, if this is the case, we must conclude that there are some humans who deserve more respect than others, and that no one will be respected as equals. Some humans will deserve much less respect than many nonhuman animals (the argument from species overlap also shows this).
Thus, those with outstanding abilities would be given much greater consideration than others. This means that the interests of people like Newton, Einstein, Aristotle, and Leonardo da Vinci will deserve much more attention and respect than other humans. This elitist position is not easy to accept.
(1) It’s justified to treat those with greater intellectual capacities better than those with lesser intellectual capacities.
(2) Human beings have different intellectual capacities.
(3) Human beings who have greater intellectual capacities should be treated better than those who have lesser intellectual capacities.
(3’) Human beings who have lesser intellectual capacities should be treated worse than those who have greater intellectual capacities.
This is contrary to the values the majority of us have. Most people believe that all human beings should be respected equally. But as we have seen, this is something we will have to reject if we accept the idea that we can discriminate against nonhuman animals because they don’t have certain intellectual capacities.
The same argument can be used if, instead of talking about intellectual capacities, we maintain that nonhuman animals shouldn’t be respected because they lack other capacities (such as the possession of language or the capacity to respect others) because for any capacity there will always be some humans who possess it to a greater degree and others who possess it to a lesser degree, or not at all.
So, ultimately, those who consider it legitimate to treat nonhuman animals unfavorably based on their capacities cannot defend equal treatment of all humans. This seems very difficult to accept, at least for most people, and this suggests that we should change our position on this, and reject arguments that deny full moral consideration to nonhuman animals.

Is there a difference between friends and acquaintances? Can acquaintances become good friends? Short answer: yes! Mary and Sienna share some useful tips on bridging that gap between ""acquaintance"" and ""friend"".
Is there a difference between friends and acquaintances?
Short answer: yes. In most cases, an acquaintance is likely someone you have only met briefly and maybe don’t know very well, whereas a friend is often a person you probably see regularly and know fairly well. For example, a friend is someone you can rely on to be there for you in the middle of the night, however you may not feel comfortable reaching out to an acquaintance in the same instance. Mary and Sienna discuss some ways to spot friends over acquaintances.
Are some people meant to stay acquaintances?
So, you’ve hit it off big time with this new person, but after a while trying to transition them from being just an acquaintance to a true, blue friend, it’s clear that things aren’t working. First things first: don’t panic! Most of the people we meet in our lives never move past beyond acquaintance stage, so try not to be too hard on yourself if things don’t pan out the way you had hoped. Try to remember that acquaintances can be a good thing! And who knows? Maybe sometime in the future you’ll be able to bridge that gap.
Firstly, if you’re set on turning an acquaintance into a friend you’ll need to do a little self reflection and see if you have any unapproachable qualities. Perhaps you feel nervous around new people or you’re never the first person to initiate conversation. Make a list of ways that you would improve and then just fake it ’til you make it! Mary and Sienna talk about being reliable, generous, and how to have more meaningful conversations.

The Scottish Government acknowledges that at one end of the spectrum a football supporter could be perceived to be someone who has an interest in a club and keeps an eye on the results, or at the other end, a season ticket holder or those who are financial investors in a club. The Scottish Government also recognises that, given the wide range of supporters' groups, it could be a challenge to know which one has the greatest legitimacy in the context of rights.
Question 7: What are your views on how to define what is a football supporter and defining supporter groups, in the context of making a law to give supporters rights in the decision-making or ownership of their football club?
530 respondents addressed this question, including 22 organisations and 508 individuals.
A widely held view was that attempting definition of supporter and supporter groups was very challenging given the wide range of involvement exhibited by supporters, from armchair followers to Boardroom representatives. It was pointed out that some supporters follow several different teams at the same or different times, sometimes changing allegience over time. Even within a football club's group of season ticket holders, different supporters may have different types of season ticket, demonstrating the difficulties in using criteria such as season ticket holder as a basis for definition.
General contributor to the club's finances ( e.g. from shareholder to someone purchasing merchandise).
Someone who attends games when they can (may not be regular attender, but more than armchair supporter).
Someone who self-defines themself as a supporter and has an emotional attachment to their club. They may not attend matches, but they continue to support their team through thick and thin.
""The individual's financial situation at any one time may mean he/she is not able to contribute, but this in no way may lessen his/her adherence to the club. Often too that loyalty extends to whole families or communities. So in our view supporters should be self-defining. If an individual defines him/herself as a supporter then he/she should not be denied that right"" (The Celtic Supporters Trust).
Member of supporter group or trust.
Someone who volunteers their time in some way for the club.
Someone on the club's membership database.
Somone who pays regularly into a funding vehicle such as Community Interest Company.
Someone who contributes generally to the club.
Someone who engages generally with the club.
The possibility of prioritising one supporter over another on the grounds of regular attendance at matches was opposed by many respondents, some of whom viewed the issue clearly in equality terms.
""If you define how much of a supporter a person is by how much financial support he/she gives the club then by definition, poorer fans are lesser supporters. Disabled fans are lesser supporters. Unemployed fans are lesser supporters. Fans who have moved away from the area or even the country for work or family are lesser supporters. I think most people would not accept this definition. At the heart of any football supporter is a love of their club. It is a bond that lasts a life time...""
One theme to emerge across several responses was that of developing a hierarchy of supporter priority (in the context of making a law to give supporters rights), possibly by awarding points according to set criteria, or a sliding scale of supporter priority, based, for example, on number of matches attended or length of time a season ticket has been held.
""...a supporter of a club should be allocated by a points system, where you accrue points up to a maximum allocation dependent on attending games, purchase of merchandise and attendance at public meetings related to the club and its existence"" (Individual).
A few respondents argued that the definitions of supporter and supporter groups were generally known and did not require more explicit definition.
Emerging from a few of the responses to the overall question of defining a football supporter was a distinction between what some perceived to be a ""supporter"" and, therefore, more deserving of involvement in decision-making at their football club, and a less deserving ""fan"".
In general, supporters were viewed as more connected to their club, financially, emotionally and physically (in terms of attending matches). Fans were perceived as admirers from afar, possibly living far away and watching matches on television rather than at the ground.
A few exceptions existed, with the concept of supporter and fan perceived as the other way around, a supporter being the more passive party, but overall, respondents perceived a hierarchy of support with football club ""supporters"" above football club ""fans"".
A minority of respondents were explicit on who they considered should definitely not be given priority over others within the context of giving supporters rights in the decision-making or ownership of their football club. It is noteworthy that these views conflict with others and with each other, with no clear shared view emerging, reflecting the difficulties respondents encountered in identifying an appropriate definition of supporter in this context.
Not armchair supporters who follow their team but do not contribute financially in any way.
Not necessarily season ticket holders/regular attendees.
Not someone who attends matches only occasionally.
Not financial investors who are involved with clubs only for a return on their investment.
Not individual supporters. Rights can go only to supporter groups.
Not necessarily supporter groups. Could be individual supporters.
Far fewer respondents attempted to define supporter groups than provided a definition for supporter. However, amongst the minority of respondents who addressed the issue, a range of attributes emerged.
Properly constituted group registered with the Scottish FA or SPFL.

Groups of supporters who buy shares.
Body which provides a voice for individual supporters and communicates on their behalf.
Once again, notions of hierarchy emerged, with a few respondents urging that no one group should have priority over another (for example, some groups may be smaller than others due to remote geography), but others suggesting hierarchical frameworks based on criteria such as number of matches attended, number of season ticket holders within the group, groups which are seen to contribute more to the running of their club, and so on.
Notions of legitimacy also emerged from responses, in particular how to ensure that those joining supporter groups are legitimate supporters of the football club. Suggestions were made to reduce the risk of ""rogue supporters"" infiltrating supporter groups, including permitting membership of only one supporter group at a time; paying a monthly fee to the supporter group; signing a contract confirming allegiance to the club; and requiring two or three referrals from other members before being accepted into the group.
The challenges of defining football supporter and supporter groups were widely recognised.

A:",365049127,0.9720146847486840,https://daily.wobb.co/work-culture/co-working-space/,"Today, for instance, I learned of the glorious joy in sleeping an uninterrupted 9 hours, and I don’t know why I don’t do this more often. Also today, I learned of co-working spaces, of which everyone should know.
The ‘jakun’ that I am, when I first heard of ‘co-working spaces’, I thought, “But isn’t every office a co-working space?” Because the logic follows that if you work with others, you’re co-working (hence “co-workers” in reference to people you work with); and if you’re co-working in the same space, that makes it a co-working space. But I was wrong.
So…What exactly is a co-working space?
To put it simply, think about the office towers omnipresent in city centers, like Menara AmBank or Wisma Lee Rubber. One company owns the whole building, but rents out offices or entire floors to other companies. Now downscale that operation to the size of an office – that’s what a co-working space is.
Picture an open-plan office, but instead of one company occupying that whole space, it’s shared by freelancers, entrepreneurs and lean work groups.
Instead of renting out office spaces and conference halls, co-working spaces rent out work desks, meeting rooms, power plugs, sometimes even free WiFi. That’s the bare bones of it. From that point on, it’s up to the imagination and ability of those who run the space to make it so much more than just a space – from exercise rooms to swimming pools, stocked pantries to fully functional kitchens, performance spaces to skill-building seminars…the sky’s the limit (all within budget of course).
More than just a space to work, co-working spaces are offering a holistic developmental experience for everyone, from the overworked freelancer to the latest greatest startup team.
Each co-working space possesses its own vibe and character. This leaks on to you and creates an environment that can make you work at your most optimal level. If one place does not emit the same positive, creative energies that you could benefit from, there is always another place to run to. You can’t do that in a fixed office where you are basically stuck with the same people and at the same desk day-in-day-out.
Also, in a fixed office you would sometimes feel the need to put on a façade to ‘fit in’ to the company’s culture. In a co-working environment there is little direct competition and also no terrible internal politics, because it is a space that consists of people ranging from many different companies, personal pursuits, or business ventures. There wouldn’t be a need for you to deal with all the negative aspects of working (ok, maybe except that one person who talks too much, but I guess all work related places have ‘em).
Bunching individuals of different unique skills and talents allows for the opportunity to provide the community shared knowledge and collaborative opportunities. It can also allow you to portray a more distinctive work identity (“Oh Hi! You are the guy that’s really good at tying knots right?”); suddenly giving more meaning to the work you do. While that statement sounds like it belongs on an ad, I’m saying it because it’s well and true.
There’s no telling who you might meet in a shared space! From designers to writers to underwater basket-weavers; it’s the perfect chance to connect and do that mystical thing we call “networking”.
No, it’s not some new-age “let the energy of other living things flow into you” mumbo-jumbo. It’s that when you’re out working with other people, when you hit a snag you can’t just give up and go rub one off like how you would if you’re at home.
Some of you might have heard of Coffitivity, which was built based on one research’s finding that our brains naturally function more creatively and efficiently when we’re immersed in a busy ambience. Also, there’s this thing you psychology majors might have heard of called “Conditioning”.
No, it’s not the stuff you put on your hair after rinsing off shampoo. It’s the reason why the new treadmill in your house will be used religiously for the first month, then left to collect dust until you get rid of it 3 years later. It’s the reason why you should not read articles on your smartphone/iPad/stone tablet when you’re lying in bed at the end of the day. It’s why some people feel stressed the moment they step into their offices.
When you’re at home, your brain goes, “Oh, home sweet home! Time to flip the switch from work hard to chill out!” I would know this, because if I had been working in my office, I would’ve finished writing this article in just under 2 hours. But if you could see me now, sitting on a sofa in my comfy shorts, hunched over a laptop that’s perched on a coffee table, you’ll understand how it has been 2.5 hours since I’ve started writing but am only halfway done.
It’s an exciting new world to discover. Try it out for yourself, and see if it works for you. Maybe the underwear and lone ranger status could have a rest. Maybe it’s time to collaborate and say hi to your fellow man. Who knows? In that very co-working space you might meet your future business partner of a multi-million dollar scheme to sell rocks with googly-eyes to the masses.
For those of you in the Klang Valley, check out Poskod.my’s excellent list of co-working spaces in KL or Jay Chong’s Top 10 list. If you’re up north in the land of Char Kuey Teow and Asam Laksa, I have it on good authority that Regus, the OG of co-working spaces, operates at least two locations on the island.
Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to find me my own co-working space to write in.",ST5,,

Directions (Q. Nos. 76 - 80 ) : Rearrange the following sentences in a proper sequence to form a meaningful paragraph. Also answer the questions following these sentences.
A. The government needs to devise a mechanism to counsel their parents which is necessary for the proper implementation of its schemes and act.
B. Even after 70 years of independence, education is still a dream for children who could be seen scavenging refuse or carrying bags of garbage.
C. Though the government has given right to education to all, it has failed to clear loopholes in the systems.
F. No body bothers to make them aware of these schemes,that's why their goals are never achieved.
(51)1. Help is used like – He could not help but shriek. It means she could not stop shrieking. Here it gives the opposite meaning.
2. Go utter also not well here. We use go for a continuous process like She went on uttering words.
3. Make has a meaning that someone else is prompting the subject to work. He made him act like this.
4. Move also gives sense of continuity. She moved on to say her version.
So all options are not according to the sentence. However the option already used in the sentence has a meaning and is correct.
(52)1. Supposedly means that it is supposed that this is the most useful out of all those invented so far.
2. ‘Showingly’ does not make any sense, the word is showing.
3. It is believed to be useful but whenever does not give any relevance here.
4. Found to be useful if invented does not have any relevance with the remaining sentence.
5. Supposingly is not a word but supposing is the correct word so it is not correct. (a) is correct.
(53)Here pretty does not mean fair or beautiful but it is to increase the degree of activity beastly. Just as we say – ‘pretty large’ means very large. It is ‘pretty beastly’. On the whole means taking the totality of the activity. So here the option (d) is the correct option.
54. Here while or when are to be linked with ‘he’ and not room. It is to say that when he left the room it bore many traces of his presence there. According to this meaning option is the most appropriate meaning that – when he left the room it bore many traces of his presence. (a) is correct.
55. Here the word ‘locally’ is an adverb whereas an adjective ‘local’ is required with the noun ‘requirements’. Instead of ‘on the lines’ ‘in line with’ is more appropriate that means according to the local requirements. So option (a) is correct.
56. This sentence shows that it is of the past tense and ‘making’ tells that it is continuous tense. Further ‘for a long time’ shows that it is of perfect continuous tense. In Past perfect continuous tense, ‘Had been + first form of verb +ing and for ‘ are used. So the sentence should be- He had been making………for more than……(a) is incorrect.
57. This is a conditional sentence.If two activities are to take place in future time, tense for first activity will be present indefinite tense and for the second it will be future indefinite tense. The sentence will be ‘ If the institute comes to his help…………So (a) is incorrect.
58. In this sentence two words ‘why’ and ‘reason’ are used for one purpose. So ‘the reason’ is redundant or superfluous remove it. (b) is incorrect.
59. The pronouns ‘anyone’ or ‘none’ etc. are treated as singular and are followed by singular verb. So ‘were’ here is incorrect. It should be ‘was’. (d) is incorrect.
60. Unless itself has a negative meaning so it does not require ‘not’ with it. It should be ‘Unless…….passes’ instead of ‘does not pass’. (a) is incorrect.
61. Adjective Far means away. It has three degrees Far, Farther and Farthest. The word required in this sentence is ‘farther’ and not ‘further’ .(d) is incorrect.
62. Here error is due improper use of tense. In such sentences there has been no activity in the past nor will it be in future time. But it is supposed if it had happened. In such cases for first action past perfect tense is used. ‘If you had employed……..’ Instead of ‘produce’ ‘production’ is correct. (b) & (d) are incorrect.
63. In examination one gets ‘marks’ and not numbers. (d) is incorrect.
64 Spellings of ‘difficult’ are incorrect. It was ‘he’ and not ‘him’. ‘to blame’ is correct. So (a), (c) & (d) are incorrect.
65. ‘Everyone’ is followed by pronoun ‘his’ and not ‘one’s’. (b) is incorrect.
1. Environment is changing. So stable, some or real are incorrect. Close also does not give any sense here. Varied is correct.
2. They do not have means so lacked is correct option.
3. Blending and growing are incorrect as these do not fit here. Out of utilizing, inclusion and adoption, adoption gives appropriate meaning.
4. Products, tools, wares do not fit here. Out of appliances and devices, the devices is the correct word.
5. Out of all options trend is the correct word.
6. Productivity is to be increased so enhance is the correct word.
7. favouring and throwing are incorrect. Showing also does not fit here. Out of trending and creating is better option.
8. Out of all options include is the correct option.
9. Here meaning is to make a thing better. For this ‘makeover’ is the correct word out of all words.
10. Studied, recorded ployed are incorrect words. Out of sorted and analysed, analysed is the correct word.
In such questions one has to find linking words. These linking words show relation of one sentence with other sentences. This means that such a sentence cannot be first sentence. In these sentences words are– Such children, these schemes, such poor and their parents. It means the sentences containing these words cannot be first sentence. First sentence should be an independent or non dependent sentence. B and C are such sentences. But B contains more information to start with some topic.Children in sentence B are referred to in D as ‘such children’. Schemes referred in D are again talked about in F as ‘these schemes’. C mentions about right to education and its loop holes and in E it tells about its result. finally in A there is a solution of the problem suggested. So the sequence is B,D,F,C,E,A. Questions can be answered accordingly.
A word that denotes a thing, place,person, quality, state, condition, position or attitude is called a Noun. A Noun is the name of a person, thing or a place.
When a Noun is used as a subject of the Verb, it is in the Nominative Case.
In this sentence John is 'Subject' writes is 'Verb' . OR John is subject of verb writes. 'John' has been used as Subject of the verb writes. Here John is used in Nominative case.
In this sentence Alice is 'Subject' and is plucking is 'Verb'. Alice is Subject of the Verb 'is plucking.' Alice has been used as Subject of the Verb is plucking. Here Alice is used in Nominative case.
In this sentence ' the students' is a Noun in Objective case.
In other words 'the students' is an object to the verb 'teaches'.
In this sentence ''football' is a Noun in objective Case.
In other words 'football' is an object to the verb ''playing'.
A Noun in Subjective Case is identified by substituting the word 'who' in place of noun. If answer to this question is noun, this noun is a noun in subjective case.
A Noun in Objective Case is identified by substituting the words 'what or whom'. If the answer to the question is noun, it is a noun in objective case.
In this sentence 'Mother and her son' are two nouns. 'Loves' is a verb.
First substitute 'who' in place of 'mother' - Who loves her son? The answer is ' mother' . So the noun mother is a noun in subjective case.
Now substitute 'whom' in place of the noun 'her son'. - Mother loves 'whom'. The answer is 'her son'. So the noun 'her son' is a noun in objective case.
Substitute 'what' in place of the noun 'football'. -- Boys play -- what?
The answer to the question is 'football'. Thus the Noun 'football' is a noun in objective case.
Father gave his son a book.
In this sentence, 'his son' and 'a book' are two objects. The object 'his son' nearer to verb is called Indirect Object and next to Indirect verb 'a book' is called a direct object.
In order to find out whether a noun used as Indirect Object is a Noun in objective case or not substitute the word 'whom' and in case of a direct object substitute the word 'what'. The answer in both the cases will be a noun. So these nouns are nouns in objective case.
In the given sentence both the nouns ' his son' and 'a book' are nouns in objective case.
There are two ways to write sentences with two objects.
1. Mother gave her son food.
2. Mother gave food to her son.
A noun used to show relation or possession is called a Possessive case noun.
My father's shirt is white.
In this sentence the noun 'My father's' shows relation with shirt. So the noun 'My father's' is a noun in Possessive Case.
Apostrophe with s is used to express relation or possession of living things only. In case of non living things apostrophe with s is not used. Instead words 'of the' are used. It is wrong to say - The table's leg is broken. The correct way is - The leg of the table is broken.
If a noun is used with a verb to make the meaning or sense of the sentence complete, the noun is called a noun complement to the verb.
In this sentence the noun ' a student' is adjoined with verb is to make a complete sense or meaning. Thus 'a student' is a noun complement to the verb 'is'.
Generally words like is am are was were seem appear look become are used.
In this sentence 'sad' is added to the verb appeared to make the sense complete.
Here 'friends' is added to the verb became to complete the meaning.
A complement having relation with Subject in the sentence is called a Subjective complement.
His son became a doctor.
In this sentence noun a doctor is a complement to the verb became but it describes about the subject 'his son'. So it is a Subjective complement to the verb 'became'.
Boys elected his son captain.
In this sentence 'captain' is a complement to the verb elected but it describes about the object 'his son'. So it is an objective complement.
In certain cases two nouns describe the same thing or person and these both nouns have one case. Such nouns are called Noun Case in Apposition.
His son, a doctor is my friend.
e.g. His son is my friend. A doctor is my friend. His son and a doctor tell about the same person.
The second noun doctor is a Case in Apposition of the noun His son.
When a noun is used to address a person or a thing such a noun is called a noun used for nominative address.
Children, do not make a noise.
In these sentences the nouns children, boys and friends are nouns of nomination of address case.
God forbidding, we lose the match.
In this sentence the noun God is connected with the main sentence with the help of a participle forbidding. There is no verb used between the noun and the remaining sentence. So such a Noun ''God' is a Nominative Absolute.
Weather permitting, we will play a match tomorrow.
In this sentence weather is a noun in nominative absolute case.

In a more modern context, empiricists, like Thomas Hobbes and John Locke, argued that knowledge (and, for Locke, language) emerge ultimately from abstracted sense impressions. These arguments lean towards the ""nurture"" side of the argument: that language is acquired through sensory experience, which led to Rudolf Carnap's Aufbau, an attempt to learn all knowledge from sense datum, using the notion of ""remembered as similar"" to bind them into clusters, which would eventually map into language.
Proponents of behaviorism argued that language may be learned through a form of operant conditioning. In B. F. Skinner's Verbal Behaviour (1957), he suggested that the successful use of a sign, such as a word or lexical unit, given a certain stimulus, reinforces its ""momentary"" or contextual probability. Since operant conditioning is contingent on reinforcement by rewards, a child would learn that a specific combination of sounds stands for a specific thing through repeated successful associations made between the two. A ""successful"" use of a sign would be one in which the child is understood (for example, a child saying ""up"" when he or she wants to be picked up) and rewarded with the desired response from another person, thereby reinforcing the child's understanding of the meaning of that word and making it more likely that he or she will use that word in a similar situation in the future. Some empiricist theories of language acquisition include the statistical learning theory. Charles F. Hockett of language acquisition, relational frame theory, functionalist linguistics, social interactionist theory, and usage-based language acquisition.

The kahoa hihi is a beautiful Niuean neck garland made from strands of tiny distinctively yellow snail shells. They are often worn by women at weddings and celebrations and during cultural performances. Men also wear the kahoa hihi as part of their performance costume.
The process of preparing the shells for use is relatively lengthy. The tiny shells are first hand picked from seaside cliffs and rock faces, followed by a method of cleaning and bleaching.
The kahoa hihi holds significant cultural values and elicits great cultural pride for Niueans. In a political context, the kahoa hihi serves as a representation of Niue and is often presented as a gift to individuals, groups, government officials, and dignitaries upon arrival to or departure from Niue. As a symbol of identity, the kahoa hihi depicts the warmth and beauty of Niue.

Directions (Q. Nos. 76 - 80 ) : Rearrange the following sentences in a proper sequence to form a meaningful paragraph. Also answer the questions following these sentences.
A. The government needs to devise a mechanism to counsel their parents which is necessary for the proper implementation of its schemes and act.
B. Even after 70 years of independence, education is still a dream for children who could be seen scavenging refuse or carrying bags of garbage.
C. Though the government has given right to education to all, it has failed to clear loopholes in the systems.
F. No body bothers to make them aware of these schemes,that's why their goals are never achieved.
(51)1. Help is used like – He could not help but shriek. It means she could not stop shrieking. Here it gives the opposite meaning.
2. Go utter also not well here. We use go for a continuous process like She went on uttering words.
3. Make has a meaning that someone else is prompting the subject to work. He made him act like this.
4. Move also gives sense of continuity. She moved on to say her version.
So all options are not according to the sentence. However the option already used in the sentence has a meaning and is correct.
(52)1. Supposedly means that it is supposed that this is the most useful out of all those invented so far.
2. ‘Showingly’ does not make any sense, the word is showing.
3. It is believed to be useful but whenever does not give any relevance here.
4. Found to be useful if invented does not have any relevance with the remaining sentence.
5. Supposingly is not a word but supposing is the correct word so it is not correct. (a) is correct.
(53)Here pretty does not mean fair or beautiful but it is to increase the degree of activity beastly. Just as we say – ‘pretty large’ means very large. It is ‘pretty beastly’. On the whole means taking the totality of the activity. So here the option (d) is the correct option.
54. Here while or when are to be linked with ‘he’ and not room. It is to say that when he left the room it bore many traces of his presence there. According to this meaning option is the most appropriate meaning that – when he left the room it bore many traces of his presence. (a) is correct.
55. Here the word ‘locally’ is an adverb whereas an adjective ‘local’ is required with the noun ‘requirements’. Instead of ‘on the lines’ ‘in line with’ is more appropriate that means according to the local requirements. So option (a) is correct.
56. This sentence shows that it is of the past tense and ‘making’ tells that it is continuous tense. Further ‘for a long time’ shows that it is of perfect continuous tense. In Past perfect continuous tense, ‘Had been + first form of verb +ing and for ‘ are used. So the sentence should be- He had been making………for more than……(a) is incorrect.
57. This is a conditional sentence.If two activities are to take place in future time, tense for first activity will be present indefinite tense and for the second it will be future indefinite tense. The sentence will be ‘ If the institute comes to his help…………So (a) is incorrect.
58. In this sentence two words ‘why’ and ‘reason’ are used for one purpose. So ‘the reason’ is redundant or superfluous remove it. (b) is incorrect.
59. The pronouns ‘anyone’ or ‘none’ etc. are treated as singular and are followed by singular verb. So ‘were’ here is incorrect. It should be ‘was’. (d) is incorrect.
60. Unless itself has a negative meaning so it does not require ‘not’ with it. It should be ‘Unless…….passes’ instead of ‘does not pass’. (a) is incorrect.
61. Adjective Far means away. It has three degrees Far, Farther and Farthest. The word required in this sentence is ‘farther’ and not ‘further’ .(d) is incorrect.
62. Here error is due improper use of tense. In such sentences there has been no activity in the past nor will it be in future time. But it is supposed if it had happened. In such cases for first action past perfect tense is used. ‘If you had employed……..’ Instead of ‘produce’ ‘production’ is correct. (b) & (d) are incorrect.
63. In examination one gets ‘marks’ and not numbers. (d) is incorrect.
64 Spellings of ‘difficult’ are incorrect. It was ‘he’ and not ‘him’. ‘to blame’ is correct. So (a), (c) & (d) are incorrect.
65. ‘Everyone’ is followed by pronoun ‘his’ and not ‘one’s’. (b) is incorrect.
1. Environment is changing. So stable, some or real are incorrect. Close also does not give any sense here. Varied is correct.
2. They do not have means so lacked is correct option.
3. Blending and growing are incorrect as these do not fit here. Out of utilizing, inclusion and adoption, adoption gives appropriate meaning.
4. Products, tools, wares do not fit here. Out of appliances and devices, the devices is the correct word.
5. Out of all options trend is the correct word.
6. Productivity is to be increased so enhance is the correct word.
7. favouring and throwing are incorrect. Showing also does not fit here. Out of trending and creating is better option.
8. Out of all options include is the correct option.
9. Here meaning is to make a thing better. For this ‘makeover’ is the correct word out of all words.
10. Studied, recorded ployed are incorrect words. Out of sorted and analysed, analysed is the correct word.
In such questions one has to find linking words. These linking words show relation of one sentence with other sentences. This means that such a sentence cannot be first sentence.

A word that denotes a thing, place,person, quality, state, condition, position or attitude is called a Noun. A Noun is the name of a person, thing or a place.
When a Noun is used as a subject of the Verb, it is in the Nominative Case.
In this sentence John is 'Subject' writes is 'Verb' . OR John is subject of verb writes. 'John' has been used as Subject of the verb writes. Here John is used in Nominative case.

In other words 'the students' is an object to the verb 'teaches'.
In this sentence ''football' is a Noun in objective Case.
In other words 'football' is an object to the verb ''playing'.
A Noun in Subjective Case is identified by substituting the word 'who' in place of noun. If answer to this question is noun, this noun is a noun in subjective case.
A Noun in Objective Case is identified by substituting the words 'what or whom'. If the answer to the question is noun, it is a noun in objective case.
In this sentence 'Mother and her son' are two nouns. 'Loves' is a verb.
First substitute 'who' in place of 'mother' - Who loves her son? The answer is ' mother' . So the noun mother is a noun in subjective case.
Now substitute 'whom' in place of the noun 'her son'. - Mother loves 'whom'. The answer is 'her son'. So the noun 'her son' is a noun in objective case.
Substitute 'what' in place of the noun 'football'. -- Boys play -- what?
The answer to the question is 'football'. Thus the Noun 'football' is a noun in objective case.
Father gave his son a book.
In this sentence, 'his son' and 'a book' are two objects. The object 'his son' nearer to verb is called Indirect Object and next to Indirect verb 'a book' is called a direct object.
In order to find out whether a noun used as Indirect Object is a Noun in objective case or not substitute the word 'whom' and in case of a direct object substitute the word 'what'. The answer in both the cases will be a noun. So these nouns are nouns in objective case.
In the given sentence both the nouns ' his son' and 'a book' are nouns in objective case.
There are two ways to write sentences with two objects.
1. Mother gave her son food.
2. Mother gave food to her son.
A noun used to show relation or possession is called a Possessive case noun.
My father's shirt is white.
In this sentence the noun 'My father's' shows relation with shirt. So the noun 'My father's' is a noun in Possessive Case.
Apostrophe with s is used to express relation or possession of living things only. In case of non living things apostrophe with s is not used. Instead words 'of the' are used. It is wrong to say - The table's leg is broken. The correct way is - The leg of the table is broken.
If a noun is used with a verb to make the meaning or sense of the sentence complete, the noun is called a noun complement to the verb.
In this sentence the noun ' a student' is adjoined with verb is to make a complete sense or meaning. Thus 'a student' is a noun complement to the verb 'is'.
Generally words like is am are was were seem appear look become are used.
In this sentence 'sad' is added to the verb appeared to make the sense complete.
Here 'friends' is added to the verb became to complete the meaning.
A complement having relation with Subject in the sentence is called a Subjective complement.
His son became a doctor.
In this sentence noun a doctor is a complement to the verb became but it describes about the subject 'his son'. So it is a Subjective complement to the verb 'became'.
Boys elected his son captain.

In certain cases two nouns describe the same thing or person and these both nouns have one case. Such nouns are called Noun Case in Apposition.
His son, a doctor is my friend.
e.g. His son is my friend. A doctor is my friend. His son and a doctor tell about the same person.
The second noun doctor is a Case in Apposition of the noun His son.

In a more modern context, empiricists, like Thomas Hobbes and John Locke, argued that knowledge (and, for Locke, language) emerge ultimately from abstracted sense impressions. These arguments lean towards the ""nurture"" side of the argument: that language is acquired through sensory experience, which led to Rudolf Carnap's Aufbau, an attempt to learn all knowledge from sense datum, using the notion of ""remembered as similar"" to bind them into clusters, which would eventually map into language.
Proponents of behaviorism argued that language may be learned through a form of operant conditioning. In B. F. Skinner's Verbal Behaviour (1957), he suggested that the successful use of a sign, such as a word or lexical unit, given a certain stimulus, reinforces its ""momentary"" or contextual probability. Since operant conditioning is contingent on reinforcement by rewards, a child would learn that a specific combination of sounds stands for a specific thing through repeated successful associations made between the two. A ""successful"" use of a sign would be one in which the child is understood (for example, a child saying ""up"" when he or she wants to be picked up) and rewarded with the desired response from another person, thereby reinforcing the child's understanding of the meaning of that word and making it more likely that he or she will use that word in a similar situation in the future. Some empiricist theories of language acquisition include the statistical learning theory. Charles F. Hockett of language acquisition, relational frame theory, functionalist linguistics, social interactionist theory, and usage-based language acquisition.

The kahoa hihi is a beautiful Niuean neck garland made from strands of tiny distinctively yellow snail shells. They are often worn by women at weddings and celebrations and during cultural performances. Men also wear the kahoa hihi as part of their performance costume.
The process of preparing the shells for use is relatively lengthy. The tiny shells are first hand picked from seaside cliffs and rock faces, followed by a method of cleaning and bleaching.
The kahoa hihi holds significant cultural values and elicits great cultural pride for Niueans. In a political context, the kahoa hihi serves as a representation of Niue and is often presented as a gift to individuals, groups, government officials, and dignitaries upon arrival to or departure from Niue. As a symbol of identity, the kahoa hihi depicts the warmth and beauty of Niue.

Monkey see, monkey do — these monkeys are getting a new home at Connecticut’s Beardsley Zoo!
Questionably rhyming couplets aside, it is true that the zoo will break ground Thursday on a spacious indoor/outdoor habitat for a troop of Black-handed Spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi geoffroyi), arriving at the zoo in spring, 2019. Native to the tropical forests of Central and South America, the Spider monkeys will join the Zoo’s family of animals when their habitat is complete.
Connecticut’s Beardsley Zoo board members, Zoo staff, and Bridgeport Mayor Joseph Ganim will gather for a groundbreaking event for the zoo’s newest habitat 11 a.m. Thursday. The site was once home to elephants, which were removed from the zoo in 1985.
The new Spider monkey habitat will feature a landscaped outdoor yard with multiple opportunities for climbing and engaging in social behaviors. The monkeys will have free choice in whether to be inside or outside, and large guest viewing windows will be offered in both locations. Naming opportunities for major donors are still available.

This is Dinah and Pluto‘s last female pup, I have named her “Jenny”. She is a well mannered, cat proof, friendly little monkey that started her leash training today and did very well. This is a stop and smell the flowers kind of girl, she is curious but cautious, watches the swallows, butterflies and especially loves one of the old cats named Bobette…she actually invites her to come and eat her breakfast of canned food with her. This would make a good kids dog if the kid is about 10 years old or older, she would bond well with a kid and just want to hang out and be their buddy. She will mature about 45 to 55 lbs. and be about 21 to 23 inches at the wither…I am thinking she will remain the smaller estimated size, she is very soft loose curly coated with a very gentle look about her. The pictures above were taken on June 30.
More pics and info below!
Dinah has only black pups left to be placed into their forever home. I have dropped the price to $600 as it is important that these lovely pups get a home of their own where they will impress the heck out of their new family with their loyalty and intelligence. Remember these are the exact same temperament and confirmation as the apricot pups, I do not know why people buy for color but that seems to be what is happening. If you go onto a car lot and there are four red cars, one is a Honda, one is a Ford and one is a Chevy and the last one is a Dodge you would not look at the color but at what is inside. These are non shedding, F1B Golden Doodles. They are sharp little characters and are noticing everything that moves, including the barn cat that likes to share their canned food for breakfast. They try to gang up on her now but this is an old wise Manx cat and she lets them chew on her a bit and when she has had enough (to eat and chewing) she skedaddles into the rafters and they sit and look up at her as if to say “How do you do that?” I could sit in the barn all day and watch these guys as they are so entertaining now.
Here are the newest pictures of Dinah‘s puppies (taken on May 30th). They will be ready to go next week (delivery date to Alberta is June 8th). Dinah’s pups met the vet today and got their second set of boosters and complete vet check, all is well! This is a very quiet litter of pups compared to some, they get all excited when I go into the pen and sit down with them, do nails, scratch bellies and then they all want to get on my lap and snuggle around my legs. I always sit on the floor with them, that way they do not learn to put their feet up on me for attention, no nipping or licking is allowed…my pups leave me with no bad habits and I try my best to council the new puppy owners to make the pup mind. People create the bad habits and then punish the puppy later on, it is much better to never let the bad habit begin. I have all the time in the world to play with puppies… who needs a clean house when they can sit and pet puppies instead?
Be sure to scroll down for more (older) pictures and information about this litter!
Dinah‘s available pups are pictured above in photos taken May 22nd. These guys are going to stay a bit on the smaller side for Golden Doodles, I am thinking. They are quite the bunch! The barn cat went into their pen a few days ago when they were eating their morning mush, and that caused a ruckus. First they woofed at her (she is a very old cat that is really puppy proof), then they took turns getting brave and to get close enough to sniff her. She calmly walked over and tasted their food. I wish I would have had my camera with me as they all went and ate with her. Once she had enough they decided it was play time and she hiked it out of there.
Below is Dinah’s apricot pup that has already been sold, pictured with yellow and orange rope ball (thanks Alex, you are going to enjoy this boy). After those photos, you’ll find some older pictures and more info about this litter.
This litter was born to Dinah and Pluto on April 9, 2011 (pictures taken May 15th). They will be ready to go to forever homes on June 4th. They are F1B Golden Doodles and will mature slightly smaller than a Golden Retriever and will all be curly coated and non shedding. These pups are robust little characters. They learned early to climb out of the whelping box. They never pee or poop in their bed now, rather they climb out and go over to where the mother goes and climb back in to bed. These guys should be very quick to housetrain as they are already trying to be clean and are only 5 1/2 weeks old! They come running when I call them and are on my lap and in my arms as soon as I sit down in the pen to play with them.

“I really became physically sick at the thought of unilaterally invading a Middle Eastern country that had not done anything to the United States,” says Ann Wright, who, after serving 29 years in the Army and Foreign Service, resigned in opposition to the Iraq War. Now living in Hawai‘i, she says she’s pleased with the activism here and the number of organizations involved in international affairs. “A lot of people are very concerned about the war here … even though this is a big military state. These men and women who’ve come back from the Middle East put their lives on the line, and they sincerely hope they’ve been asked to do the right thing.” In 2015, Wright protested outside of President Barack Obama’s vacation home, and is currently advocating for reduction of the Army’s presence in Hawai‘i.

He smiled and crushed out his cigar beneath his open-toed right sandal. “I just want you to walk with Oscar.” He looked around and gave a shrill whistle that could have cracked the marble altar in St. Peter’s Cathedral.” Then, in a flash, there appeared a big hairy St. Bernard dog with a face that looked much like Joe Pesci.
“What is that?” I said, backing away.
Oscar slobbered all over my Florsheim shoes and then glared at me. “We’re not going to have a problem here, are we, pal?” he said in a Joe Pesci voice.
“Enough!” God bellowed and the ground beneath the bench shook and the sky darkened just above my head.
“And if I refuse?” I said, folding my arms over my chest in a defiant manner.
Again God’s eyes turned black and the dark cloud over my head burst and showered me with a hard, stinging rain.
Oscar sniffed the ground, found a scent he liked, and squatted over a patch of green grass. He showed me every one of his teeth and grunted loudly.
“Bingo again, Pal,” he said.
Global warming is in the news again. Now one noted German Professor of Gastronomy, Maxwell Von Schmelling, said he has discovered the cause of all that gas.
“This has got to stop or vee will all be asphyxiated!” Prof. Schmelling warned.
According to the good professor, the human species is mostly at fault. I mean, how much gas can be blamed on shrimp or squid? So we humans, he said, must limit the amount of flatulence we produce on a daily basis, or die.
According to Schmelling, the Greeks, Russians, and French are the worst offenders, followed by the Irish due to their consumption of large amounts of dark beers. Although the English never admit to passing gas, Prof. Schmelling’s findings prove that they do. It’s just that the human ear is incapable of hearing their emissions. However, many English Setters and a certain bred of sheep in Scotland reportedly have gone deaf due to the extremely high pitch of gas coming from England’s populace. Schmelling attributed this to the English having such tight asses.
Adolph Hitler’s gas, he admitted, was so frequent and so foul that 12 high-ranking Nazi generals surrendered to the Russians rather than spend one more day in the confines of Hitler’s underground bunker. Likewise, a few brave followers of Osama bin Laden have defected to the American side because they said the air in their cave was putrid. They said they asked their leader to put in a window or two, or even a small a/c unit, but he denied their request.
Prof. Schmelling demanded that a law be passed immediately to limit the amount of gas each human being can expel before being reprimanded and flogged, or sent to a gas chamber. At one point during his speech in Berlin he became so furious with the doubting audience that he turned to the German Chancellor and shouted: “Mein Fuhrer! You must heed my words!” At this point, he was shackled and dragged away.
Personally, I agree with the deranged professor. A law should be passed.
Of course, old farts like me would be exempt because we no longer have control of our bodily or mental functions.",ST5,,

NBYT will perform Stuart Little, based on the children’s classic by E.B. White, on May 1, 2 and 3, 2015, at Holmes Elementary School in New Britain.
Stuart Little is the story of a mouse born into an ordinary New York City family. Stuart’s adventures, both great and small, are brought to life as an ensemble cast of children plays multiple roles—Stuart’s family, their cat Snowbell, Margalo the bird, a giant dog, a car, and other people and things—in the life of the mild-mannered mouse trying to survive in a big people’s world. The stage adaptation keeps all of the charm and adventure of the original story by E.B. White, author of other titles including Charlotte’s Web and The Trumpet of the Swan. The book was also the basis for a popular 1999 film and sequels. The NBYT production is directed by Kristianna Smith.

Here are the words which someone spoke and the report by the person themself of the words that they had recently spoken. Is there any rationale to explain the difference in word-order between the first instance and the second?
I can't add anything to your post Stephen, unless the number of people interested moves someone to respond, but I do find it interesting. I know little about such things, and what little I know I probably misunderstand. The first instance seems difficult to me because there are only two constituents in that specific phrase, I think. I would expect the verb would come first unless the prepositional phrase served as point of departure, but I don't think that is the case. I would also expect the verb to come before the phrase if the word order was unmarked, so I assume something is in focus? (If that is the proper word for it.) That leads me to think that the phrase is topic comment where the comment comes first. The question in my mind though is whether the prep. Phrase is fronted for emphasis or whether the verb is being emphasized by being placed in the back. I am inclined to think the latter. I will give someone the opportunity to correct or at least comment on my foolishness, before I add more to it. I hate to see your questions to unanswered when you make so many efforts to help others.

What is a disciple-making church? Introduction Our 'DNA'. Re-cap last week: in a gospel-centred church, we want all of our lives to be explicitly controlled by the reality of the gospel. By who we really are, in Jesus. Gospel-centredness is the 'why?'; disciple-making is the 'what?' I.e., in light of the glorious gospel, what should we do? Answer: make disciples. We'll think today about what that means. Next week is the 'how?' question; how do we make disciples? That gives rise to our third value, being 'simple'. In other words, by intentionally structuring church so that discipleship can happen in community and relationships. What is a disciple? 'Learner' Life long apprenticeship to Jesus through all of life, for all of life. Growing up into what we already are. Brought into union and communion with the tri-une God, cf v19 'Discipleship' is a word for the whole package; mission and maturity. Discipleship is about the real world; about being restored to Genesis 1. This is so important today, when unprecedented levels of things nudge us to live in an abstracted world, away from real people and real relationships. 'Mission' is actually someone with a name. Your own front door is the church's front door. We can go online, we can go to a conference, we can use an app, we can watch a video or listen to a podcast. All those things separate us from the actual people around us. Why make disciples? v28 All authority - the fulfilment of the great plan. New Adam, back in God's place, ruling over all. God has a multi-national people to 'uncover' and 'gather'. We are totally confident in this! v20 Jesus is with us always How are disciples made? Link to last week: how do people mature and grow? Through the gospel cf Colossians 1.23-28 and Colossians 2.6-7 v19 It's local and global 'As you go'. Hasn't this been your experience? By the word and in community [Sundays; CGs; smaller contexts]. It's always plural in the NT (and nearly all the OT - except the 10Cs] It happens at heart level first and foremost. 'Famous, loved, and followed'.Don't believe this? Look at how the NT defines 'fruit'; they are character features that come through habitual heart-level decisions. Discipleship only happens in, through, by, with, and into Christ. If it is not about Jesus, it isn't discipleship. We 'learn Christ' cf Colossians 2.6-7. His call is come and follow 'me', not a system. What is a disciple-making church? (and what is it not)? Where we order our lives around mission and maturity. Both/and, not either or. Individual and family level; relationship clump level; whole church level. But if it isn't happening at individual level, it isn't happening [cf economic illustration, or blood flow illustration] Where we keep bowing our hearts to the Lord Jesus, along with our heads and hands. Hence, we need to be gospel-centred in order to be disciple-making. Not getting angry with people for where they are in their journey/growth; you simply do not know the truth. You can't walk a mile in their shoes, even if you're sure you can. Instead, the question is always, 'what's the next step in my/your discipleship?' The goal is not growth, the goal is disciple-making. The goal is not cultural transformation, the goal is disciple-making. The goal is not a neat, tidy, orderly community, the goal is disciple-making. How are we doing? These questions are not to crush or condemn us, but to make us think. For some the answer will be 'yes', in which case thank God for the grace he has given you. If the answer is discouraging, ask God for help. He is our helper! Decide what the next step is. Who are you intentionally pursuing? Who are you intentionally praying for? Persisting in prayer for? Can you show us any proof of this if we were to ask? If you're a parent, are you teaching your children a system, or teaching them Jesus? Some tests of discipleship: Feelings towards God; Feelings towards other Christians; Feelings towards suffering; Readiness to serve and to lose; In general, a God-centred and cross-shaped life Will you love the people in front of you? cf John 13.35 - not just some kind of apologetic to the wider world, but a crucial proof of whether you know you're a disciple! What fears hold you back from the risks of getting to know unbelievers, or sharing your life in community? What idols, like comfort, security etc? Do you love the people around you here? Have you committed and chosen to love them; to like them? When were you last in someone at TCC's home? When did you last have someone over? Wrap-up What is a disciple? Life long apprenticeship to Jesus through all of life, for all of life. Growing up into what we already are. What is a disciple-making church? Where we order our lives around mission and maturity. Why make disciples? Because Jesus the man is Christ the Lord on the throne. We are a new people together in him. What's your next step?",ST5,,

He lied a lot, like those were stray dogs, who ate his animals… later told those were his dog and many other lies. But soon we found dogs in nearby barn. Dogs had many fresh and old founds, which showed there have been tortured not the first time. We should mention that after finding dogs David just escaped and hided himself at home and only Police could make him go out. He was so scared of us. As Armenia does not have animal protecting legislation, we found many other infraction, like his car was not with license plate etc. Dogs are in our shelter now, recovering.

He lied a lot, like those were stray dogs, who ate his animals… later told those were his dog and many other lies. But soon we found dogs in nearby barn. Dogs had many fresh and old founds, which showed there have been tortured not the first time. We should mention that after finding dogs David just escaped and hided himself at home and only Police could make him go out. He was so scared of us. As Armenia does not have animal protecting legislation, we found many other infraction, like his car was not with license plate etc. Dogs are in our shelter now, recovering.

Answer:",365049127,0.9704406161131050,https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/458934/is-no-news-is-good-news-of-italian-origin,"Is “ no news is good news” of Italian origin?
Virtually the modern saying appeared some years later in James Howell's 'Familiar Letters' (c. 1645) with the line, 'I am of the Italians mind that said, no news, good news'."" From ""Wise Words and Wives'.
The first recorded use of this exact expression in English is by James Howell in 1640, who wrote, ""I am of the Italians' mind that said, 'Nulla nuova, buona nuova'.
Italian sources say that the expression “nulla/nessuna nuova, buona nuova” (and all its dialectal variances) derives from the Latin saying “nulla nova, bona nova”.
Ngram appears to suggest a consistent increase in usage of the proverb only from the early 19th century.
Is there actual evidence that James Howell really contributed to the usage of the proverb in England drawing on the Italian version, (probably Florentine at that time)?
Or was it just a direct English translation from Latin (quite still in vogue in England at that time) to which probably referred King James I?
Someone has to venture an answer, even if it is sketchy. There is circumstantial evidence.
Pas de nouvelles bonnes, bonnes nouvelles.
Very little is readily available on its origin, except a (non-scholarly) page that indicates, too, its Italian origin. So let's pursue that trail.
In Italian, it is used in its authentic Latin form.
Indeed, the Latin proverb was sufficiently in common use in Rome, to have been carved on some monument (if someone cared to obtain the source indicated, we would know more about it).
Problem: nulla nuova is not considered correct Italian, since the Latin meaning of ""nullus"" (no, as is no news) was not carried forward into modern Italian! The meaning of nullo, is rather as ""void, invalid, null"".
meant, for the Ancients, none/no one: he did no [nullo] harm; but today it persists only in the proverb: ""nulla nova, bona nova""
a. this issue of ""nullo"" versus ""nullus"" was a common grammar issue in standard Italian [1887: a few decades after the unification of the country, when there was a strong drive to impose its use].
b. the Latin form was in wide use and was the proper one.
The best explanation seems phonology and more precisely vowel breaking. (Florentine) Italian tended to break a consonnant + 'o' like nova/bona into diphtongs: nuova, buona.

Who are the royal people abroad the ship? The play opens with a violent sea storm—the tempest of the title. A ship carrying several noble personages is being battered and buffeted by the crashing waves and howling wind. How can you say from act I scene 1 that Shakespeare had a sound knowledge of a ship at sea? I do not think that whether or not Shakespeare had a sound knowledge of a ship at sea can be stated with a great deal of confidence based on act 1, scene 1.
Most of the scene is made up of drama What did Prospero do with his magical books and wand? Prospero, the Duke of Milan, uses What makes Gonzalo feel uncomfortable despite the storm?
In the exciting opening scene of the play, the King of Naples and his group of nobles struggle to survive the violent tempest that threatens to sink their ship.
As the Boatswain attempts to rouse What has Miranda seen that makes her suffer? Miranda explains to her father, Prospero, in act 1, scene 2 of the play that she is suffering because of what has happened to those whose ship has been caught in the storm.
What does Prospero feel entitled to in The Tempest? Prospero in The Tempest seems to feel that he is entitled to a lot of things. The actions that he takes to stir up the tempest and begin the action of the play are all for the purpose of taking When the banished Prospero first arrives on his island exile, he discovers that Ariel has been imprisoned in a pine tree by the evil witch He is shocked to see another living Who wants power in The Tempest?
It was a loss of power that led to Prospero being banished to a remote island. Back home, he was Why is Prospero overthrown?

Do you think Prospero had planned to Prospero appears to experience quite a transformation throughout the play. The arrival of his foes on the island With help from Ariel, Prospero divides the people shipwrecked on the island into three groups It is important to One of the reasons The Tempest is considered a comedy is because Prospero forgives the men who Throughout the play, Prospero has been dictatorial and controlling.
But in the final act he becomes forgiving. The play offers three reasons for this change. First, Ariel motivates Prospero to However, both in chronological and thematic terms, the play could indeed be What is the comical element in The Tempest? One of the big ones is the result of the culture shock experienced by Miranda, who has What events cause Prospero to reveal his past to Miranda?
She begs him to stop. What does Prospero say regarding his love for study and books? Initially, Prospero prizes his books above just about everything else. Indeed, his love of books and study helps to explain why he was deposed as Duke of Milan. He was so engrossed in his studies Prospero uses his magic to control both Ariel and Caliban, albeit in different ways.
In that sense his attitude towards them is inherently exploitative. Ariel and Caliban exist to serve him, and Why is Alonso feeling depressed and sad? Alonso, the King of Naples, is feeling sad because he has lost his daughter Claribel to marriage, and now, shipwrecked on a deserted island, he believes his son, Ferdinand, is also dead.
Why is act 3 called the climax? Explain the high points in the three scenes of act 3. Every action that Prospero has instigated up to this point has been for What happens when Miranda and Ferdinand meet each other for the first time? Miranda has never seen such a handsome, dashing man before.

Shakespeare wrote plays for people from all walks of life. These plays were written to be watched. While reading, one has the luxury of going back and re-reading to try to understand a new word from the context. Not so, in a performance.
What has happened is that the Bard’s works have survived far better than a love letter or a pamphlet by a man on the street. To summarize, first documented use doesn’t necessarily mean a first use of the word. It may not even be the first documented use of the word. It’s just that that’s the earliest we have unearthed, so far.
That said, there are some words whose coiners we know about. This week we’ll see five such words.
noun: The study of body movements, such as gestures or facial expressions, as a form of communication.
Coined by the anthropologist Ray Birdwhistell (1918-1994). From Greek kinesis (motion), from kinein (to move). Earliest documented use: 1952.

We all know the classic Shakespearean lines – “To be or not to be,” “O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?” or “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?” — but how would these famous lines have sounded to Elizabethan audiences? Are we currently misinterpreting the Bard? This question has been on the mind of Shakespeare scholars, directors, actors, and audiences for a long time, and has proved a tricky problem. The central issue is how to re-create an oral phenomenon, with predictably few pronunciation guides to work from.
Again, should we be reading this ‘Where’ and ‘Nhere’ or ‘Weer’ and ‘Neer’?
Through analysis of spelling variants, rhymes, and current usage, these questions are finally being answered. To modern ears, Shakespearean speech sounds a strangely familiar cross between contemporary Irish and Scottish, with a hint of Yorkshire and Bristolian thrown in. Test your knowledge of common Shakespearean words with our quiz, and listen to recordings of all the phrases – as the Elizabethans’ would have heard them. How well do you really know Shakespeare?

But I want you to think back even further. Remember last month, when I couldn’t figure out the whole Lady Anne/Richard trimeter thing? And how, by the end of the discussion, I was still as in the dark?
Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.
Pray you, do my commendations; I would be glad to see it.
I would you heard it groan.
Would that do it good?
Will you prick't with your eye?
No point, with my knife.
Now, God save thy life!
And yours from long living!
If Shakespeare did pre-date Howard Hawks by three centuries, I’d say the Bard stole this kind of rapid dialogue from His Girl Friday.
Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration! O, that's the Latin word for three farthings: three farthings--remuneration.--'What's the price of this inkle?'--'One penny.'--'No, I'll give you a remuneration:' why, it carries it. Remuneration! why, it is a fairer name than French crown. I will never buy and sell out of this word.
O, my good knave Costard! exceedingly well met.
Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man buy for a remuneration?
Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.
I thank your worship: God be wi' you!
This seal'd-up counsel. There's thy guerdon; go.
Gardon, O sweet gardon! better than remuneration, a'leven-pence farthing better: most sweet gardon! I will do it sir, in print. Gardon! Remuneration!
Berowne’s use of the word “guerdon” confuses Costard again, who even as he mispronounces the word makes an incorrect assumption to its meaning.
The first striking repetition is of the word “sake” (“Out of consideration for; on account of one’s interest in” [OED[), building his argument on account after account after account. But note, too, the subtle repetition from line to line: the ending word of one line is repeated in the next (save for the second “men” in the fourth line). This repetition allows his argument to be driven forward, while noting what came before it. It’s a remarkable speech.
Thou now request'st but moonshine in the water.
Then, in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.
Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.
Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.
Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.
Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?
You took the moon at full, but now she's changed.
Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.
Here, Rosaline is like the moon. The moon goes through phases, always changing from night to night, just as Rosaline’s moods and actions change from moment to moment. The King uses a bawdy reference to bring the simile to a close: he will be the “man in the moon,” he is sure of it… he will have her sexually. Of course, unbeknownst to him, he’s barking up the wrong tree.
And give him light that it was blinded by.
Save base authority from others' books.
And every godfather can give a name.
Berowne begins his speech with a rhymed couplet, and follows up with a quatrain in an alternating rhyme. But he’s just warming up: he presents another rhyming couplet (this one fully end-stopped with a period) before diving into the sonnet proper. Beginning with “Study me,” he outlines his argument. First, a quatrain (ABAB that comprises a single sentence: Show me how to please my eye by having it stare into the beautiful eye of a woman, which will blind my eye, but her eye will become my guide and show me the way. The next quatrains (CDCD) is another standalone sentence: Learning is like the sun that cannot be stared at because only small victories come to those who constantly study, and those victories come from the thoughts of others — experts — found in a book. In the next quatrain (EFEF), he takes these experts to task: These men on earth, who study and give names to the stars, gain nothing more of those stars than who have walked about free of unrelenting study and don’t know the names of the stars. He ends his sonnet and argument with a final rhyming couplet (GG): To know too much is to know nothing but rumors, what others have said (“fame” in Shakespeare’s day meant not only “renown,” but “rumor” as well [OED]), and if you want to name something, become a godfather. Berowne’s sonnet, embedded transparently in his longer speech, perfectly uses the same building techniques of the standalone sonnets: The first two stanzas, quatrains, set up the situation or problem; the third quatrain usually contains a turn in the thinking, the beginning of the resolution or solution; the final rhyming couplet tends to state or restate the theme of the poem.
Mocks married men; for thus sings he, ""Cuckoo!
Mocks married men; for thus sings he, ""Cuckoo!
Then nightly sings the staring owl, ""Tu-who!
Then nightly sings the staring owl, ""Tu-who!
Think of these final two poems as the concluding couplet of a sonnet: they sum up what has happened. The first song is by Spring, the season of love, of flora and fauna (daisies to turtledoves). But the season of love also brings fear to married men of being cuckolded.
could this fear be an analog to (or even a cause of) an oath of abstinence?
The second song is sung by Winter, the season of death. But it is also the season when the family is brought together under one roof, huddled for warmth, with dinner cooking in the pot that the wife stirs. Death and solemnity may reign at the end of the play, but maybe this song is supposed to tell us that as long as we have each other, we’ll be all right.
of course, at the end of the play, the lovers are NOT together… so what to make of that?
So, over the course of the last two days, we’ve seen an explosion of language in Love’s Labor’s Lost, in forms varied (and some unseen in the Canon until now).
Why the sudden release of linguistic prowess? Had Shakespeare been feeling stymied by the linguistic constraints put on him in the historical and tragical genres, or by the source materials in the comedies? Did he use this first sourceless play to also experiment with language? Or was he just playing?

We all know the classic Shakespearean lines – “To be or not to be,” “O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?” or “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?” — but how would these famous lines have sounded to Elizabethan audiences? Are we currently misinterpreting the Bard? This question has been on the mind of Shakespeare scholars, directors, actors, and audiences for a long time, and has proved a tricky problem. The central issue is how to re-create an oral phenomenon, with predictably few pronunciation guides to work from.
Again, should we be reading this ‘Where’ and ‘Nhere’ or ‘Weer’ and ‘Neer’?
Through analysis of spelling variants, rhymes, and current usage, these questions are finally being answered. To modern ears, Shakespearean speech sounds a strangely familiar cross between contemporary Irish and Scottish, with a hint of Yorkshire and Bristolian thrown in. Test your knowledge of common Shakespearean words with our quiz, and listen to recordings of all the phrases – as the Elizabethans’ would have heard them. How well do you really know Shakespeare?

A good example of this would be the official insistence of the U.S. government that airstrikes should commence because they have the details of an alleged chemical weapon attack by Syrian government forces.
Thinking Americans should reject these claims for a couple of reasons.
First, prior to the invasion of Iraq 11 years ago, the very same intelligence apparatus was stating as fact that “we know where the WMD are” when they did not. Why would we trust them now?
Remember, the only information we have right now on the alleged chemical attack has come from our own government. This is the same government that regularly lies to us about whether or not it spies on us and why. Propaganda is a part of our daily lives whether we like it or not.
Secondly, even if the Syrian government, or the CIA-backed rebels, or some other third party did carry out a chemical attack, our government lacks any kind of moral standing to intervene militarily. This lack of moral authority may explain our leaders’ desperate attempts to hyperfocus on 1,400 more deaths in a civil war that has claimed over 100,000 lives so far.
President Obama as well as key congressional leaders are seeking to order the military to conduct “limited strikes” to send a message to Syria’s president, Bashar Hafez al-Assad, and his government that killing civilians is wrong. The irony is palpable.
No matter how well intentioned, any type of military strike will create unintentional civilian casualties. That is the nature of military action.
Where the U.S. has not been attacked or even threatened by the Syrian conflict, it is morally indefensible to engage in offensive war against Syria. The concept of “might makes right” simply does not square with the most basic principles of justice.
Even attempts to justify bombing Syria on humanitarian grounds fall short when we remember the 500,000 Iraqi children and elderly who died as a result of U.S. backed sanctions in the 1990s. Nor should we forget that the U.S. government sold chemical agents to Saddam Hussein and supported his use of them against the Iranians during the Iran-Iraq war.
The question is not whether people have been dying in various horrific ways in Syria, but rather, by what authority does the U.S. government presume to commit military acts of retaliation against a nation that has neither harmed nor threatens us? All the posturing between Congress and the president serves to mask the fact that our government has no moral standing in this matter.
At the moment, it appears that we have a president who foolishly pledged to interject America into a conflict that has nothing to do with us. Congressional leaders have fallen into lockstep with the president, proving at last that there is no real difference between the two major parties. As a nation, we are now divided into the establishment and the remnant. Moral laws and constitutional fidelity notwithstanding, the establishment’s leaders appear determined to lead the world by force.
But have they considered what they will likely reap?
In his essay, Bastiat argued that for every policy or law that is instituted, there are unseen consequences that will arise. Rather than focusing on what is only immediately apparent, Bastiat counseled that wise leaders would carefully consider the unseen consequences that may arise.
At this point, the political class seems determined to recklessly plow ahead. Instead of spinning our wheels trying to convince them to reconsider the immorality of bombing Syria, perhaps our time and efforts would be better spent setting our own houses in order.
At least that way, our nation’s leaders aren’t as likely to succeed in dragging all of us down with them.
I voted for Pres. Obama in the last election but, I cannot support his actions should he choose to fire the first shot in Syria. I will vote against any leader who stands behind our President in this matter and I will continue to express my contempt for the escalation to war.

A good example of this would be the official insistence of the U.S. government that airstrikes should commence because they have the details of an alleged chemical weapon attack by Syrian government forces.
Thinking Americans should reject these claims for a couple of reasons.
First, prior to the invasion of Iraq 11 years ago, the very same intelligence apparatus was stating as fact that “we know where the WMD are” when they did not. Why would we trust them now?
Remember, the only information we have right now on the alleged chemical attack has come from our own government. This is the same government that regularly lies to us about whether or not it spies on us and why. Propaganda is a part of our daily lives whether we like it or not.
Secondly, even if the Syrian government, or the CIA-backed rebels, or some other third party did carry out a chemical attack, our government lacks any kind of moral standing to intervene militarily. This lack of moral authority may explain our leaders’ desperate attempts to hyperfocus on 1,400 more deaths in a civil war that has claimed over 100,000 lives so far.
President Obama as well as key congressional leaders are seeking to order the military to conduct “limited strikes” to send a message to Syria’s president, Bashar Hafez al-Assad, and his government that killing civilians is wrong. The irony is palpable.
No matter how well intentioned, any type of military strike will create unintentional civilian casualties. That is the nature of military action.
Where the U.S. has not been attacked or even threatened by the Syrian conflict, it is morally indefensible to engage in offensive war against Syria. The concept of “might makes right” simply does not square with the most basic principles of justice.
Even attempts to justify bombing Syria on humanitarian grounds fall short when we remember the 500,000 Iraqi children and elderly who died as a result of U.S. backed sanctions in the 1990s. Nor should we forget that the U.S. government sold chemical agents to Saddam Hussein and supported his use of them against the Iranians during the Iran-Iraq war.
The question is not whether people have been dying in various horrific ways in Syria, but rather, by what authority does the U.S. government presume to commit military acts of retaliation against a nation that has neither harmed nor threatens us? All the posturing between Congress and the president serves to mask the fact that our government has no moral standing in this matter.
At the moment, it appears that we have a president who foolishly pledged to interject America into a conflict that has nothing to do with us. Congressional leaders have fallen into lockstep with the president, proving at last that there is no real difference between the two major parties. As a nation, we are now divided into the establishment and the remnant. Moral laws and constitutional fidelity notwithstanding, the establishment’s leaders appear determined to lead the world by force.
But have they considered what they will likely reap?
In his essay, Bastiat argued that for every policy or law that is instituted, there are unseen consequences that will arise. Rather than focusing on what is only immediately apparent, Bastiat counseled that wise leaders would carefully consider the unseen consequences that may arise.
At this point, the political class seems determined to recklessly plow ahead. Instead of spinning our wheels trying to convince them to reconsider the immorality of bombing Syria, perhaps our time and efforts would be better spent setting our own houses in order.
At least that way, our nation’s leaders aren’t as likely to succeed in dragging all of us down with them.
I voted for Pres. Obama in the last election but, I cannot support his actions should he choose to fire the first shot in Syria. I will vote against any leader who stands behind our President in this matter and I will continue to express my contempt for the escalation to war.

But after Mom left, the lies started popping out, like the time Josey left her little brother at the library and told Dad he’d run away. Then Josey meets a boy who tells bigger whoppers than she does. He says he’s the son of a privateer who’s been dead two centuries. He’s so convincing Josey’s brother believes every word and sets off to find the privateer’s hidden treasure. When her brother disappears, Josey is sure she knows where he's gone. But everyone thinks she's lying again. Everyone, that is, except the so-called privateer’s son. He knows she’s telling the truth because jeweled riches are only part of his tale. There’s also the snooperscope, a device that makes time leaps possible, like the one that brought him to the present. The story is fantastical...and yet Josey will do anything to save her brother—including traveling back in time two hundred years with a boy she can’t trust.
After months of rain, water was plentiful, collecting naturally in small depressions and topographical low spots. The birds no longer visited the bird bath. Yet the caretaker kept the basin clean, the water sparkling, the surrounding vegetation from jungling into concealment for predators. When the dry days returned, as dry days do, the bird bath was as it had always been. Where's your touchstone?
The summer Andy disappeared started out the same way summers had since I was ten—with a Sunday afternoon airplane ride to visit Gran Ryan. The flight was smooth and fast, the same as usual. The only difference from the past five trips was that Andy was with me.
He wasn’t too much trouble, even for a nine year old genius. He was just my klutzy little brother. I didn’t mind watching out for him. Not too much. Anyway, who else was there? Mom and Brent-The-Blond were living the golden life in California and Dad worked all the time at the accounting firm. I was all Andy had.
He tugged his seatbelt and bounced on the bench seat as I guided Gran’s ancient red pickup away from the airport. Gran sat on the other side of him, calm as always.
I clenched both hands around the steering wheel and concentrated on not getting lost in the airport’s circular maze. I’d gotten my learner’s permit last month, the day after I turned fifteen. This was the first time I’d driven with anyone except Dad or my teacher. I wished I could drive the way Gran did, with one elbow resting on the edge of the doorframe, casual and confident.
The breeze, hot and sandy as Florida’s beaches, gushed through the open windows. Gran’s curly white hair flared away from her face. The hairstyle was new. She looked different. Then the scent of her lilac perfume floated across the pickup cab. I breathed it in. After the upheaval of the past year, the familiar fragrance was a balm.
Andy stilled. He always got quiet when I lied. The dumber the lie, the quieter he got.
“Your dad didn’t mention that,” Gran said.
Behind us, a jet screamed into the air. I ducked. I was afraid to take my hand off the steering wheel to crank up the window.
“I wouldn’t put it that way,” Gran said.
“I would.” My voice was flat, hard. Angry. And sad too, which was confusing.
When Dad said he wanted me to take Andy to Gran’s for the annual summer vacation, I’d jumped at the chance to get away. Why had I thought leaving home would mean leaving the sadness behind?
Andy studied his sneakers, probably wishing the conversation was over. One of his shoes had come unfastened when he climbed into the truck. He would lose it the minute we got out at Gran’s house. Assuming I managed to get us to Gran’s house in one piece.
Another heavy truck thundered past. I white-knuckled the steering wheel and drove over the Pithlocoochee Creek Bridge and onto the exit. The skinny two-lane road would take us the last few miles to Sea Cove.
With the rush of traffic left behind, I quit strangling the steering wheel. I glanced at Gran. She was chewing her lower lip. That was a sure sign she was figuring out the best way to phrase whatever lesson she wanted to dump on me. She was a semi-retired English teacher and she had an arsenal of words she could use.
She wouldn’t, any more than she’d forget the whopper of a lie I’d come up with a week ago. Dad had told her about that one when he called to make sure he could still unload Andy and me on her for the summer.
“Do you know what a liar’s punishment is?” Gran asked.
She grinned. Rudeness never ruffled Gran. She believed people only smarted off when they knew they were wrong but didn’t want to admit it.
“I thought we were going to Sea Cove,” Andy said.
Sometimes I thought he should have been named Aleck.
The view from the front windshield changed as I drove. The scorched beaches gave way to dry pastures, herds of rangy cattle, and the stench of hot manure. In another ten minutes we’d reach Sea Cove and the scenery would change again. Then we’d be surrounded by the sparkling blue-green water of the Gulf of Mexico and the salty scent of the sea.
Because Dad was dead set against me getting a job like a normal fifteen year old, I’d asked him to open a mutual fund account for me. Then I’d begun investing my allowance. My ridiculously tiny allowance. The paltry amount was Mom’s fault. The family budget had plunged to new lows when she left.
I planned to make enough with my investing to pay part of my college tuition since Dad couldn’t help much and Mom wouldn’t. I enjoyed the research, the statistics, the financial decision-making.
Go figure. I was an accountant’s daughter and I liked being in charge of my own money. I liked even better that the numbers never lied to me.
“They were driven by greed. That never works out well.” Gran reached for the truck’s radio and punched a preset button. She began humming along with some song that had been ancient when Dad was a baby.
“You never mentioned pirate treasure, Josey.” Andy’s voice was high-pitched with excitement. He was probably imagining wood chests overflowing with gold doubloons, pieces of eight, chain ropes of gold and silver, diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds.
In past years I’d imagined that too. No more. Once Mom left, I gave up silly fantasies of vast riches and instant wealth. Dreamers untouched by life’s realities might be foolish enough to believe in fairy tales—or pirate’s gold. Not me. After watching Dad struggle to get a grip on his shattered life, I knew better. There was no happily ever after.
“The Morgan pirate treasure.” Gran switched off the radio and launched into the story.
I stared out the windshield, pretending not to listen.
The basic tale hadn’t changed since the first time I’d heard it, though Gran had added a few embellishments. I wondered who she’d been practicing on, then remembered she was on call as a substitute teacher for the Sea Cove school system. Thanks to her, generations of Sea Cove residents were probably familiar with the legend of Alastair Morgan, a pirate who’d haunted the Florida coast during the early 1800s.
Her words didn’t sink in for a long moment. Then I stomped the gas pedal and whipped the wheel in a circle. The truck leapt forward and we all jolted back in the seat. I eased off the gas, guided the truck to the shoulder, put it in park, and shut off the engine.
“Everybody all right?” Gran asked.
My breath jerked in and out. In a newer vehicle, the air bags would have deployed and we’d be enveloped in white fabric. A voice would be talking to us from the dash, sounding concerned and offering to send help.
But all that surrounded us in Gran’s old truck was hot air and the stink of burnt rubber. I trembled. In my mind, I could still hear the blare of the horn, the shriek of the tires. What had happened to the skinny boy? Was he hurt?
I didn’t want to look; didn’t want to see his bloody, crumpled body.
Still gripping my phone, I risked a glance in the rear view mirror. Andy twisted in his seat.
The boy was nowhere in sight.
Gran walked to the spot where the black tire marks marred the road. She shielded her eyes and stared at the beach. Then she came back and climbed in the truck.
“Where’d he go?” I asked.
“Then you’ll be arrested,” Andy said.
“So we drive away like nothing happened?” I asked.
Gran chuckled. “Right again. He, his son, and what remained of his crew drifted out to sea in rowboats. They were picked up by a Spanish galleon several days later.” She paused, waiting.
“How do you know?” Andy asked.
I put the truck in gear, checked for traffic, and pulled out onto the highway.
Sometimes Andy sounded like one of those academic journals he used to research the homework for his pre-college coursework. Even more amazing was the fact that he wasn’t simply repeating what he’d read. He understood what he was saying.
Gran chewed her lip again, but for once her extensive vocabulary failed her.

Does the emoji with raised eyebrows and a frown really look “unamused”? 😏😏 Emojis are tiny pictures of facial expressions or objects used in text messages, emails and on social media. Today there are close to 3,000 emojis in the Unicode Standard. Over 10 million emojis are sent each day throughout the world—92% of all people who communicate online or through text messages use emojis, with more than a third of them using emojis daily. They are no longer a “laughing matter” for lawyers these days. Increasingly, they are bones ☠️ 🦴 of contention in lawsuits ranging from business disputes, sexual harassment, stalking and defamation.
In one Michigan defamation lawsuit, the meaning of an emoticon, an emoji-like image created with text characters from a standard keyboard, was up for debate. A comment on an Internet message board appeared to accuse a local official of corruption. The comment was followed by a “:P” emoticon. Judges on the Michigan Court of Appeals concluded that the emoticon “is used to represent a face with its tongue sticking out to denote a joke or sarcasm.” The court determined that the comment could not be taken seriously or viewed as defamatory or derogatory.
Puzzled lawyers across the country are turning to seminars, informal meetings and continuing legal education classes to discern innuendo in seemingly innocuous pictures of martini glasses 🍸 🍸 and prancing horses 🐎 🐎. Researchers at a law school in Melbourne, Australia, actually produced a 61-page study on the topic. With emojis sent from an iPhone to a non-iPhone operating system, the emoji sent can be quite different than the emoji received. This poses real interpretation problems for lawyers.
One employment lawyer in Washington, D.C., was stumped by a combination of emojis that included horses 🐴 🥧 and one that “looked like a muffin” in text messages associated with a sexual harassment case. After soliciting her colleagues’ opinions, her client told her it meant “stud muffin.” The client viewed the emojis as an extension of alleged un-welcomed sexual comments. The reality is that the use of emojis is limitless, and people will keep using their technology to “communicate” through pictures and symbols.
In 2018, emojis or emoticons were subjects of disputes in at least 53 federal and state court opinions. This was up from 33 in 2017, 25 in 2016, and 14 in 2015. One such case involved a producer in a dispute with her former business partner, a middle-aged man, who allegedly sent sexually explicit texts to a potential female employee. In one text, the potential employee responded with an emoji that depicts a red-lipstick kiss mark 💋 💋. The factual issue at trial was whether she approved of his advances or was politely trying to keep her distance. Lawyers asked the potential employee what she wanted to convey, but even her answer did not resolve the debate. It’s like the “crying smiling face” 😂 😂—is that laughing so hard that you’re crying, or is it something else?
In a 2013 legal battle between J.C. Penney Co. and Macy’s Inc. over the sale of Martha Stewart-branded products, then Penney CEO acknowledged during trial that he included a smiley face 😄 in an email in which he boasted about a deal to sell her products. Was this really necessary and what did he mean by it?
In Israel, a strange trial involved a couple looking for an apartment. They texted the landlord a series of emojis, including a smiley face 😄, comet 💫, a champagne bottle 🍾, dancing Play Boy bunnies 👯‍♀️, and a chipmunk 🐿. The landlord believed, based in part on the emojis, that the couple had agreed to rent the apartment. Relying on the emojis in the couples’ texts, he took down the for-rent listing, but then sued the couple when they stopped responding to his messages. A judge found in favor of the landlord, reasoning the couple had negotiated in bad faith and fined them a month’s rent as damages.
Emojis are here to stay as technology evolves. Analysts refer to the uptick in emoji use as “watching the birth of a new language.” With authors tweeting millions of regretful tweets shared per day, the legal profession may be dealing with lawsuits aplenty—all over what started out as 54 smiley face emojis when Apple introduced the iPhone—today, the iPhone offers a broad range of hundreds of emojis, and Android and other operating systems have joined the ranks and continuously invent more puzzling emojis 🤣 🥺 for lawyers to debate.",ST5,FALSE,

Liberia and other West African countries were struck by Ebola Virus Disease in 2014, killing over 4,000 in Liberia alone – the highest in the region.
Because the source of the deadly Ebola outbreak between 2014 to 2016 in the West African region was not definitive, a research has been going on by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the National Institute of Public Health (NPHIL) to establish whether bats carry Ebola.
“We have sampling bats for the past two years in Liberia,” the Health Ministry announced in a release issued on Thursday, January 24.
According to the MOH, the discovery is significant because it is the first detection of the Zaire ebolavirus in West Africa and provides important evidence that is particular bat may be a natural host of Ebola.
The discovery of Zaire ebolavirus in the creature in the cave-dwelling insect-eating bat, a Greater Long fingered bat, was a collective effort of the MOH, NPHIL, the Forestry Development Authority (FDA) and the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA).
It is funded by USAID and sampling and testing was conducted by the PREDICT project led by Eco Health Alliance and the Society for the Conservation of Nature in Liberia.
Meanwhile, the Ministry has announced that studies are still ongoing to determine whether more of this type or other types of bats are infected, and how bats spread the virus, adding that the information will he used to develop strategies to reduce the risk of future outbreaks.
The MOH in the release signed by Health Minister, Dr. Wilhelmina Jallah and NPHIL Director General, Tolbert G. Nyeswah called on the public to observe these preventive measures including: “avoid hunting bats, killing and coming in direct contact with bats.

True, False, or Neither?",365049127,0.9621442790286220,https://screenrant.com/john-carter-plot-details-images-trilogy/,"There's been a very controlled stream of information that's been released in regards to Disney's John Carter, the adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs' famous series of sci-fi novels about the planet Mars. Even the title of film (formerly John Carter of Mars) has been trimmed in order to seemingly downplay the sci-fi nature of the project (a curious decision, to say the least).
A number of sites were recently granted an edit bay visit to glimpse behind-the-scenes of John Carter and see what director Andrew Stanton (WALL-E) and his production team have planned for the sci-fi adventure epic, which Disney is hoping to launch as a successful new franchise.
The film tells the story of war-weary, former military captain John Carter (Taylor Kitsch), who is inexplicably transported to Mars where he becomes reluctantly embroiled in a conflict of epic proportions amongst the inhabitants of the planet, including Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe) [a giant green warrior creature] and the captivating Princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins). In a world on the brink of collapse, Carter rediscovers his humanity when he realizes that the survival of Barsoom and its people rests in his hands.
We've selected some of the more intriguing bits of info from the edit bay reports, covering topics such as the plot of John Carter, the look of the Mars planet and culture and the characters who propel the story. Aside from the actual building blocks of the film itself, we also learn a bit about what the studio has planned for the John Carter brand and how they hope to market it - including why ""Mars"" was dropped from the title of the movie.
Andrew Stanton: I know I'm going to get this question all day and probably for the rest of my frickin' life: Why 'John Carter?' This has had quite an evolution of me figuring out what was the best thing to do for this book to preserve what I thought was timeless about it, what I thought was the resonant elements about it, but not be afraid to tweak or alter things for the benefit of it, so that it would translate the best it could to screen...I also found that — this is the wrong crowd to get this — not everybody's into sci-fi. I've tried really hard to capture what I thought was universal and timeless about this book that is above and beyond the genre itself. I don't want to exclude anybody from a wrong first impression assumption about this movie or this property, so I didn't want to lie and say it isn't what it is, so I said, ""Let's sell the character that we put all our efforts towards.""
Believe me, Mars is going to come into this thing, title and everything, before this whole journey's over. You've just got to be patient. There was a grand design to all this thing...You've got to know that it was not a studio-driven hammer on me, and it was not a decision that came quickly. I put a lot of thought into what's the most promising way to make a good first impression to a majority of the world that does not know anything about this, and invite them in and hopefully make them enjoy it as much as the people that do love it. That's the best way I can put it.
Stanton: Most people know me at Pixar as the guy that doesn't like to do sequels or very reluctant to do sequels. The irony wasn't lost on me when I asked them to do this first book to option the first three. I said, ""I really want to try to attack the first 3 like a trilogy and give us a fighting chance to introduce it to the world the way it was introduced to me,"" which was as an ongoing series with a promise of something going on — not as a cold crafts franchise, but again, to try to capture what I felt as a young kid when I got introduced to them.
There was already 11 books, and they were my 'Harry Potters.' I wanted to see if we could do the same, get off on the right foot with this one. They were very receptive to that fact, and that's exactly what we did. We tapped all three, knowing that the first one was really going to be the only promise of what could be made and [if] it succeeds and does well, then we'll move on.
Stanton: ""Character was probably my biggest focus on the project...I went with my Pixar gut and experience and got actors because of their eyes, their voice, and their acting ability...[Their dialogue] is very heightened prose, and I decided to round up the most seasoned actors I could, a lot of them British. I would often make fun of the dialogue and call it 'Pulp Shakespeare'. I wanted to make sure when they say something out of their mouths, there was gravitas to it that you would believe it, that you would buy.""
Stanton: ...It’s a period film of a period we just don’t know about. It’s as if somebody has done their Martian history research really, really well and called in all the authorities... I don’t want it to seem like this is images of creatures that people have been drawing on their notebooks their whole life and just want to selfishly see realized on the screen; I want you to go, “No, sorry, this is actually how people dressed in Aztec times” or “This is how people bargained in Japanese feudal times.” Can we capture that faux authenticity?
So much has been derived from this book over 100 years that my first dilemma was, “How the hell do you make this and not look like you’re being derivative yourself?” It wasn’t until Nathan Crowley...came in, and I wanted somebody that was not a famous sci-fi guy. I wanted somebody that would think more literally. He comes more from an architectural background. How would he attack some of these things? How would a different world come up with doors and windows? Not necessarily how we would do it—that challenge.
Stanton: ...[My] other main issue was, “How do I deal with these archetypal characters?” These four main characters in particular, John Carter and Dejah Thoris...I needed to dimensionalize these heroes. Carter’s pretty much a do-gooder for most of these books; he can be very vanilla, very 2-dimensional at times. Dejah was too much of a damsel in distress. You’ve got to remember, they were the fresh adventure ideas at the time that became tropes. Could I make both characters and made a little bit more of them, but still retain what I felt was an innate sense of justice in Carter and the strength of Mars at the core of Dejah? After many casting calls and an elaborate week of film tests, I found my two heroes. I really struck gold. Taylor Kitsch as Carter and Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris.
Taylor plays damaged goods really well, and the thing I lucked out on was he’s such a pantomime with things that aren’t there. I kept calling him my modern-day Bob Hoskins. He could act against nothing. That was required of him, as if it was there. That was an added bonus with what I was already getting with him. Lynn wasn’t really on my radar, and she came in with an inner strength and a demanding intelligence that I could not ignore until it translated on screen incredibly well. Neither are hard to look at, so that doesn’t hurt.
Neither of them are incredibly familiar faces yet, and that’s a big thing for me too, if I can have any say, that I want to believe they are who they’re playing. If you’re going to play these characters that are going to be possibly seen again and again, it would be great to get off on the right foot and you can follow in belief that they are who they are. That’s all I ever want when I go with somebody: I want to be sucked in, and I want to believe it.

Liberia and other West African countries were struck by Ebola Virus Disease in 2014, killing over 4,000 in Liberia alone – the highest in the region.
Because the source of the deadly Ebola outbreak between 2014 to 2016 in the West African region was not definitive, a research has been going on by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the National Institute of Public Health (NPHIL) to establish whether bats carry Ebola.
“We have sampling bats for the past two years in Liberia,” the Health Ministry announced in a release issued on Thursday, January 24.
According to the MOH, the discovery is significant because it is the first detection of the Zaire ebolavirus in West Africa and provides important evidence that is particular bat may be a natural host of Ebola.
The discovery of Zaire ebolavirus in the creature in the cave-dwelling insect-eating bat, a Greater Long fingered bat, was a collective effort of the MOH, NPHIL, the Forestry Development Authority (FDA) and the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA).
It is funded by USAID and sampling and testing was conducted by the PREDICT project led by Eco Health Alliance and the Society for the Conservation of Nature in Liberia.
Meanwhile, the Ministry has announced that studies are still ongoing to determine whether more of this type or other types of bats are infected, and how bats spread the virus, adding that the information will he used to develop strategies to reduce the risk of future outbreaks.
The MOH in the release signed by Health Minister, Dr. Wilhelmina Jallah and NPHIL Director General, Tolbert G. Nyeswah called on the public to observe these preventive measures including: “avoid hunting bats, killing and coming in direct contact with bats.

True, False, or Neither?",365049127,0.9672261691532640,http://www.snapnetwork.org/groping_fondling_nov18,"Numerous high-profile cases of sexual violence and abuse have have been exposed in recent years, with the same words cropping up again and again: “groping”, “fondling”, “inappropriate touching”. What each of these terms usually means is sexual assault. But both in casual conversation and in the press, we will go to almost any lengths to avoid saying it.
(B) does not consent to the touching, and (A) does not reasonably believe that (B) consents.
The Crown Prosecution Service guidelines further clarify that “touching is widely defined and includes with any part of the body, or with anything else, and can be through clothing”. The definition is clear.
Sometimes, the reason behind a reluctance to use accurate language is more compassionate than malicious – an attempt to avoid the reality of what happens to girls and women on a regular basis. It is easier to rely on euphemistic language, such as “groping” or “fondling”, than to talk about sexual assault. But that doesn’t help, because we inadvertently end up downgrading the severity of the offence, which, in turn, helps normalise it.
The Archdiocese of Cincinnati, under the leadership of Archbishop Dennis Schnurr, Auxiliary Bishop Joseph Binzer and chancellor Father Steve Angi, have perfected this art of deception. The sexual actions of Father Bacon against our family are described as such “It does seem clear that Father Bacon ignored orders from ecclesiastical superiors to have no contact with your family, specifically your daughters”. This occurred after repeated detailed verbal and written violations were reported to the Archdiocese of Cincinnati in 2014 and 2015. The Decree on Child Protection states if their is a “Semblance of Truth” a priest must be removed from contact with the children. The Archdiocese failed to do this for over 15 months. Father Bacon was finally removed for “Medical Leave” after more allegations were reported. He was still not isolated from contacting our children.
The Altoona-Johnstown Diocese, PA, will often use such language in their compensation fund established in 1999. They have a list they created of sexual behaviors and the stated amounts awarded to victims. Obviously, the Church will downplay the repeated criminality of sexual offenses of kids. This list is included in the state AG report.
As a clinical psychologist, I discuss the damage done in an article on Brain Blogger. These assaults are invasions of body integrity and result in severe psychosocial trauma. The Church is much more concerned about the integrity of this global corporation.",ST5,,
