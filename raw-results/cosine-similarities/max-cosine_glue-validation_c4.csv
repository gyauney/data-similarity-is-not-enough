""If you want ya LITTLE money come get it"" Why do some people get so offended when you become concerned with the whereabouts of money you have loaned to them? Don't worry I'll wait here for an answer that makes sense. Do people not know the difference between ""borrowed"" money and ""gifted"" money? If you don't want to pay it back or plan to pay it back... Don't borrow it in the first place. I wonder if psychologically it is easier to ask to borrow then to ask to have? I don't make it a practice to allow my friends to borrow money from me because I know that money is the root of all evil and it will and relationships quicker than Taylor Swift can. Currently the only people I can trust to borrow money from me and pay you back within reasonable time are my best friends and my immediate family, anybody else will get the side-eye add some shade thrown at them and much speculation before I even pulled out my wallet. I recently allowed a friend to borrow a fairly small amount of money from me but as soon as I even fixed my lips to ask for it back suddenly I was hit with a mountain of excuses and insults. I was always taught that excuses were tools of nothingness and those who specialized in that seldom in success. There is nothing wrong with needing additional time to pay someone back money that was borrowed a simple communication of that usually suffice. But please refrain from becoming A ghost who suddenly can't respond to phone calls or text messages or from being all of us suddenly offended that someone dared to ask for the coins that they allowed you to borrow no matter how small the amount you still needed to borrow it at one time so have the courtesy to pay it back within a reasonable time or communicate a payment plan if needed.
As I was thinking about this topic it also made me think about just debt in general. We have become a society that thrives on borrowing money without the ability to actually paying it back. Does that mean that we are living outside about means or being irresponsible with our money? The average American household has about $6600 worth of credit card debt. After you add interest rates and the fact that most people just pay a little over their minimum payment each month it is easy to see why we stay in debt. I'm not going to factor in student loans in this conversation because that's a struggle that is all too real for me right now.
We all have a little bit of decency in us, some of us are like ogres and that decency may be hidden under many layers. Use common sense when borrowing, make plans to pay it back within a reasonable time. Don't be a ""Classless wonder"" or an ""useless nonentity"". Don't put your friends or family in an awkward position where they are reluctant to help you in your time of need because they know that you don't apply basic decency when you borrow.

First, he considers what individuals do with informational privacy. What is an interest in privacy of information, he asks? Well, it’s an interest in enforcing an information asymmetry in markets. Information asymmetry is presumptively bad because it causes distortion in the price mechanism; the price mechanism is in turn the reason that markets can claim to be both epistemically and normatively justified. They are epistemically justified because market price signals the social value of something much better than any sort of centralized planning process would do, and it does so without introducing all the inefficiencies of an enormous state apparatus. The price mechanism is normatively justified because it presents no special intrusion into the lives of individuals: we are all free to do what we want and signal (with our willingness to pay) what is important to us. In the case of privacy, for example, if I present myself or some good I am selling to you, “privacy” basically means that I’m trying to withhold relevant information about that good from you. If I apply for a job and hide a criminal record, then I’m trying to get you to overvalue me as a potential employee by keeping you ignorant of my past. Accordingly, the law should not protect such refusals to disclose, and in some cases ought to compel disclosure. Thus the first part of Posner’s article.
But now we have a couple of fairly obvious problems. First, where’s the comparison? Assuming that individuals use privacy to conceal discrediting information, we need to know whether the loss associated with this hiding is greater than whatever gain the privacy provides. Even from Posner’s paper, it’s not clear that’s the case, but he also stacks the deck by treating individuals and corporations differently (more about that in a minute). Conversely, do legal protections for corporate privacy like trade secrets encourage innovation? And, if they do, at what cost? Because IP involves monopoly pricing, some deadweight loss (people who want the product but not enough to pay the monopoly price, which means they don’t get the product and the producer doesn’t get a sale) is inevitable, though economic theories of IP tend to downplay this question.
Whether or not intellectual property spurs innovation is a very, very difficult empirical question, and in this case it’s made more complex because trade secrets need to be compared with patents as drivers of innovation, and patents are often defended at least partly on the grounds that they require those seeking them to publicize their technique in return for the exclusive right to market it. There’s an emerging literature that strongly suggests that, at least in some contexts, innovation happens either just fine or even better without IP protection (I am relying on the patents literature here, because I know it better than trade secrets, but the points I’m making should generalize since they are caused by the effects of information asymmetries, not their mechanism). The founding analysis is provided in this paper about the fashion industry, but there’s enough sector-specific work that Elizabeth Rosenblatt has attempted a theoretical account.
However these empirical questions turn out, however, there’s a more troubling asymmetry: why is it that individuals would only use privacy to hide information but not to innovate? After all, as Foucault notes, it is precisely theorists like Posner’s sometimes co-author Gary Becker who insist that individuals need to be understood as “entrepreneurs of themselves.” Not only that, there is now a literature that indirectly answers Posner on this point. For example, Julie Cohen argues that privacy is necessary for the sort of free play that enables innovation. Even if she is wrong about this point – and it’s controversial – the larger point that privacy is necessary for the development of the sort of subjectivity we value is made in a variety of places, and isn’t particularly novel (see, e.g., Jeffrey Reiman here, way back in 1995). Similarly, it’s not hard to find evidence that corporations use information privacy-based arguments to hide defects in their products; tobacco is only the most-discussed example.
But is there a smoking gun (outside the actual gun industry, which fights to suppress research into gun safety and pushes laws restricting doctor-patient speech about firearm safety)? In other words, is there a case where we can identify a structural problem associated with corporate privacy – and not just one that depends on malfeasance or cases analogous to hiding defects in one’s house? In his review of the informatics of health law and policy, Frank Pasquale makes the case that too much corporate privacy, in the form of siloed medical information, damages both public safety and innovation. Part of the reason for this arguably falls under the rubric of corporate malfeasance, such as the tendency of pharma to suppress research findings that would damage its products’ sales (see: Vioxx), or to define clinical trials in a way that artificially inflates safety (e.g., by excluding those who removed themselves from clinical trials because they were experiencing too many adverse effects) and efficacy (e.g., by comparing with a placebo, but not the current standard of care).
The sort of argument here is analogous to concerns long expressed about pharma patents, which (whatever good they may do) also encourage quite a lot of waste, as research is directed toward ‘me too’ drugs (multiple remedies for erectile dysfunction or acne) rather than addressing unsolved problems (especially those that affect the poor; for papers making this sort of argument, see, e.g., here and here). So too, whatever is gained in innovation might be lost in a reduced rate of diffusion. More generally, they are reminiscent about the sorts of problems identified in the anti-commons literature, which explores the way that allocating too many property rights leads to a predictable under-utilization of resources because somebody always has the incentive to hold out for a use that would be better for them personally (so it’s the opposite problem of the tragedy of the commons). Even without the veto, too many exclusive rights increase the price of research by requiring multiple licenses.
“Negative space is likely to arise under the following four overlapping conditions: (1) when creation is driven by something other than exclusivity-based financial gain; (2) when granting exclusivity would significantly harm or deter other creation or innovation; (3) when public or creator interest in free access to creations exceeds the risks of diminished exclusivity incentives; and/or (4) when creators prefer to reinvest in creation or innovation rather than investing in protection or enforcement of intellectual property” (322).
In the case of health data informatics, where we have high levels of corporate privacy, it seems that considerations of efficiency dictate that things ought to be different, and the space for corporate privacy should be more negative. Following Rosenblatt’s schema (but treating it normatively), note that (1) makes sense in at least two ways: on the one hand, the positive externalities of better use of health data are presumably significant and could be incorporated into business models with the right regulatory structures; on the other hand, there are other market factors (like first-movers, or research subsidies (which Pasquale discusses in this context)) that could motivate innovation; (2) is represented by the siloing and anticommons problems; (3) is about getting the health benefits sooner and addressing problems of diffusion; and (4) ought to be a matter of what protections the regulatory schemas provide, and Pasquale makes the case that they could do better than it does on precisely this point.
So even if we assume the basic framework of Posner’s argument – information markets are good, innovation is good, efficiency is good, and so forth – it looks like the actual situation is not as he describes. In health informatics, at any rate, we need less corporate privacy. In the meantime, the way that internet disclosures can go viral, combined with the greater accessibility of damaging personal information like criminal records, and the growing ability to discriminate on the basis of speculative, risk-based data, mean that the personal costs to a lack of privacy can be greater than they were in an era of small data and small-town gossips.
In this case, in short, Posner has it backwards.
Judge Richard Posner’s well-known application of law and economics to privacy yields results that appear, well, ideological. First, he considers what individuals do with informational privacy. What is an interest in privacy of information, he asks? Well, it’s an interest in enforcing an information asymmetry in markets.

The big economic boon from a Silicon Valley Super Bowl might not be as super as once thought.
Santa Clara officials this week began weighing whether the city can still make money from a Super Bowl and related events after stomaching a new list of financial demands from the NFL -- including giving up huge chunks of tax revenue. The San Francisco 49ers' new Silicon Valley stadium is a finalist to host either the 50th or 51st Super Bowl in 2016 or 2017.
Before local leaders can submit a bid in May to host the big game, the NFL is requiring the Santa Clara City Council to formally adopt a resolution of support for the Super Bowl -- and then put its money where its mouth is.
""We have to give up something financially,"" City Attorney Ren Nosky said Thursday. ""They have a big entourage of people; they put on a lot of events, they're going to fill up a lot of hotels.""
The exact terms of the deal are still being discussed in closed session, beginning with a meeting held Tuesday, and could be finalized before the end of the month. City officials said the NFL's offer also applies to the other finalist cities seeking to host the Super Bowls: Miami and Houston.
Essentially, the NFL wants to lease the $1.2 billion Santa Clara stadium and the surrounding area -- possibly including the Santa Clara Convention Center, a nearby soccer park and parking lots -- for Super Bowl week at a much cheaper rate than normal, Nosky said. The league also wants other concessions, including possible tax breaks or a portion of the tax revenues received from hotels or other venues during the events.
""The NFL being the NFL, they obviously have the wherewithal to try to impose certain concessions from the host cities,"" Nosky said of the $9 billion-a-year league.
NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said Thursday that the league also requires host cities to forego sales tax charges on Super Bowl game tickets, which are typically very pricey. Other host cities have exempted the NFL and its employees from taxes on visits and sales during the Super Bowl.
""The Super Bowl brings significant economic (activity) to a host community, estimated to be several hundred million dollars,"" Aiello said.
So exactly how much would Santa Clara benefit? That still remains to be seen as San Francisco, acting as the official host city, would get most of the events leading up to the game.
Santa Clara's challenge is to determine whether it can still make money from the Super Bowl even after giving concessions to the NFL. Nosky said the city is looking at the experiences of similar suburbs that have hosted the Super Bowl in the shadow of big cities -- such as Glendale, Ariz. (home of the Arizona Cardinals) East Rutherford, N.J. (New York Giants and Jets) and Arlington, Texas (Dallas Cowboys).
The Bay Area is competing with South Florida, home of the Miami Dolphins, for Super Bowl L in 2016. The loser will battle Houston, home of the Texans, for Super Bowl LI in 2017. The NFL owners are set to select the winners at their May 21 meeting.",correct

Surprisingly, Twain's words pretty much describe biblical prophecy.
In the vast majority of cases, the biblical prophets were not in the business of predicting the future-that idea came along much later in the history of prophecy-but of saying something important about the present, though sometimes in terms of the future. Prophet doesn't mean one who predicts what is to come but refers to the Greek word prophētēs: ""one who speaks for another.""
In Hebrew scripture prophets spoke for God. Their visions, revelations, and other intense mystical experiences gave them a certain standing and authority to defend God in their day and bring the people-kings included-to task for superstitious beliefs, idolatry, and moral failings. Prophets brought and interpreted the word of God to a people who needed to be reminded of it.
Most of the discussion of prophecy in the New Testament comes from St. Paul, though prophets show up in the Acts of the Apostles, which calls some of them people who ""encourage and strengthen the believers"" (Acts 15:32). In the gospels John the Baptist was ""regarded . . . as a prophet"" (Matt. 14:5), and the travelers on the road to Emmaus called Jesus a ""prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people"" (Luke 24:19). What's more, many scholars think Jesus' prophetic calling to be closest to his own understanding of himself.
Paul's well-known list of those with particular gifts in the church includes prophets (1 Cor. 12:28), and he exhorts members to ""pursue love and strive for the spiritual gifts, including prophecy"" (1 Cor. 14:3). Prophecy for Paul seemed to involve those who spoke with particular insight and wisdom about the things of God.
But prophecy was not an unlimited gift. To discern what was false from true prophecy, Paul said prophesying had to be an orderly activity subject to other prophets' testing. Like all spiritual gifts, prophecy was for ""building up"" the community, not destroying it.
While the church does not formally use the name prophet for those outside of scripture, it has seen any number of people who took the role of the prophets who came before them: to call the community to be true to itself. Figures such as Francis of Assisi, Catherine of Siena, Bridget of Sweden, and others had vivid direct experiences and communicated them for the benefit of the church.",correct

Dennis Palmer (62) stepped down after 37 years as a retained firefighter at Kibworth Fire Station.
In the same week he retired, the county Fire Authority announced proposals to axe Kibworth Fire Station.
“People have joked that they waited for me to retire before they made the announcement!” said Mr Palmer, who lives and works in Kibworth.
“But seriously, if there is an incident in the Kibworth area, people will have to wait that little bit longer for firefighters to get here.
Mr Palmer, a married father-of-two, has been “on call” for the Fire Service since he joined in 1978.
As a retained firefighter, he trained regularly and responded to emergencies, but also had a main job as an electrician.
He will still keep up with his “day job” as the owner of Dennis Palmer Electricals.
Mr Palmer said his most memorable moment as a firefighter came while fighting a factory fire in the Catherine Street area of Leicester.
“We were assigned to the ALP (the hydraulic Aeriel Ladder Platform) and I soon found myself about 120 feet up spraying water onto a factory fire.
“You’re basically in a bucket, and in those days you weren’t even harnessed in. And there was a massive gas main still going nearby.
He said a call-out in Kibworth over Christmas showed the value of Kibworth Fire Station.
“It was a fire caused by a tea-light catching a curtain, and because of the smoke from the fire, a baby was struggling to breathe.
But he said that the job had changed significantly during his time in the fire service, with the number of fires decreasing - thanks to better safety precautions - and the number of road traffic accidents attended by the service on the up.
“Road traffic accidents are a little bit more demanding, because you have people trapped” he explained.
Retained firemen like Mr Palmer are paid, but he said: “Anyone who joins for the money doesn’t last long.
He said it was the sense of helping his community - and the rushes of adrenalin from incidents - that kept him in the fire service for 37 years.
Now he has retired, he says he is looking forward to “getting my life back”.
“It can be difficult when the family has something planned, and you suddenly get a call-out” he admitted. “I won’t miss that.
“But if I hear the ‘alerters’ going, I’m sure I’ll still want to drop what I’m doing and go straight away.",incorrect

James Jackson’s guilty plea last month marked the first-ever conviction of a white supremacist on terrorism charges in New York state history, the Manhattan District Attorney’s office said.
Jackson’s sentence was the maximum penalty he could have received under New York law, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said Wednesday.
“The court today has an opportunity to declare that violent white nationalism will not be normalized and that its perpetrators will be sentenced like the terrorists that they are,” he added.
“His lost soul and broken spirit permitted him to act as he’d never acted before,” Sosinsky said, maintaining Jackson’s time in the army made him feel lost and worthless.
“You can never forgive him for that, you know. He got life in prison, but Tim is gone, and we will never see him again,” Nimmons said.
Nimmons and Portia Clark, another friend of Caughman’s, both said they were focused on honoring Caughman.
“We love you, Timothy, and you will always be in our hearts,” Clark said.
Jackson, who said he was bent on purging the Earth of black people, had been charged with plunging a sword into 66-year-old Timothy Caughman on a Manhattan street in 2017 simply because Caughman was black. Caughman stumbled around bleeding for some time before he collapsed and died.
Last month Jackson pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in furtherance of an act of terrorism, second-degree murder as a crime of terrorism, second-degree murder as a hate crime and fourth-degree criminal possession of a weapon, the DA’s office said.
Jackson had been expected to plead earlier in connection with the crime, but he asked it be briefly put off because he had taken pain medication.
Prosecutors say Jackson traveled from Baltimore to New York in March 2017 and stalked several black men before attacking Caughman at random.
Jackson later told police the slaying had been practice for further assaults on black people.
Jackson previously plead not guilty to murder as a hate crime and as an act of terrorism in the death of Caughman. His lawyer said at that time he was looking into whether an insanity defense would be appropriate.
Authorities previously said Jackson admitted killing the Caughman at random as part of a plan to kill black men in New York City. Caughman was stooped over a pile of trash when he was attacked from behind with a sword.

Ian Tomlinson, a resident of the City of London, was on his way home from the newsagent where he worked when he was caught up in the police cordon surrounding protesters at the Bank of England. His death is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
During the two day summit, police attacked many protesters, arrested a total of 127 people, and detained many more. On April 1 some 85 people were arrested. Police also raided two squats in the London area and attacked peaceful protests at the Stock Exchange, the Bank of England and other locations.
On April 4, several hundred protesters participated in an “Emergency protest against police G20 brutality” outside the Bank of England, where they demanded an “independent public inquiry into the instances of police violence that occurred throughout the week and to establish the full circumstances of Tomlinson's death”.
The initial statement by the City of London police, following a post-mortem, said that Tomlinson “died of natural causes” and had “suffered a sudden heart attack while on his way home from work”. The police claimed that they were unable to help Tomlinson when he collapsed as they faced a hail of missiles from the crowd. Sections of the media immediately rushed to back up the police version of events.
Statements from people at the demonstration refuting these claims have appeared on numerous Web sites and blogs. One of the eye witnesses described them as “ridiculous” and added the “protesters were there helping from the word go”. He described how his friend who had first aid knowledge tried to help Tomlinson. Another said, “The only attitude from people in the crowd was to help this guy who was clearly hurt”.
Others have said that the immediate actions by police following Tomlinson’s collapse may have led to his death. According to witnesses, the police refused to allow people present to help him and did not administered any life saving cardiopulmonary resuscitation to Tomlinson.
An eye-witness, Peter Apps, said, “Four police with two police medics came. They told her [the first aider] to 'move along'. Then they pushed her forcibly away from him. They refused to listen to her [the first aider] when she tried to explain his condition"". According to the Indymedia Web site, “The first aider, who did not wish to be named, said ‘The police surrounded the collapsed man. I was standing with the person who'd called 999. The ambulance dispatcher wanted to talk to the police, the phone was being held out to them, but the police refused’”. Another witness, Elias Stoakes, said, “We didn't see them [the police] perform CPR”.
The Observer newspaper on April 5 contains accounts claiming that Tomlinson was the victim of police violence and had been “assaulted” by them immediately prior to collapsing. One witness said that he was attacked by the police and struck about the head with a baton.
Photographer Anna Branthwaite, described by the Observer as, “an experienced press photographer”, has told the IPCC, “I can remember seeing Ian Tomlinson. He was rushed from behind by a riot officer with a helmet and shield two or three minutes before he collapsed”.
Branthwaite added in her testimony, “He [Mr Tomlinson] was not a mouthy kid or causing problems, but the police seemed to have lost control and were trying to push protesters back. The police had started to filter people into a side street off Cornhill. There were a few stragglers who were just walking through between the police and protesters. Mr Tomlinson was one of those”.
Amiri Howe reveals how he saw Tomlinson being hit ""near the head"" with a police baton. The paper states that, “Howe took one of a sequence of photographs that show a clearly dazed Mr Tomlinson being helped by a bystander”.
Another protester said the man she later recognised as Tomlinson was pushed aggressively from behind by police officers. She said, “I saw a man violently propelled forward, as though he'd been flung by the arm, and fall forward on his head. He hit the top front area of his head on the pavement. I noticed his fall particularly because it struck me as a horrifically forceful push by a policeman and an especially hard fall; it made me wince”.
The Observer published two photos showing Tomlinson on the ground shortly before he died. In a clearly distressed state with his arm in the air, he is seen gesturing towards a group of riot police.
Speaking of Tomlinson’s death, Liberal Democrat MP David Howarth said, ""Eventually there will have to be a full inquest with a jury. It is a possibility this death was at police hands"".
Tomlinson’s death took place within the context of an unprecedented police operation costing £7.2 million, the most expensive in police history. According to official figures, “Operation Glencoe” involved 2,500 police officers from seven forces. The policing included erecting a “ring of steel”, including barriers and police checkpoints, at the ExCeL centre in the London Docklands where the G20 met, the use of helicopters, snipers mounted police, riot vans and dogs. The Daily Telegraph reported, “Planners have successfully made this one of London's most inaccessible and inhospitable venues for a protest by closing the nearest station and forcing protesters to walk 20 minutes along a major dual carriageway, and across a flyover, to a holding pen, signposted as being 620 metres away from the ExCeL itself”.
Another source claimed that the police operation was much larger than official figures. On April 1, the first day of the protest, the Times published an article stating that there were, “Up to 5,000 police officers drawn from more than 30 forces...preparing to confront anarchists and environmentalists”.
It added that the, “Metropolitan Police says that 2,500 officers will be on duty in the Square Mile alone today, but sources say that number is a deliberate public understatement intended to play down the seriousness of the situation”.
Prior to the demonstration, organisers had stated their concerns about inflammatory and provocative comments from senior police officers. Commander Simon O'Brien of London's Metropolitan Police said the police had “well-rehearsed tactics” and “will not tolerate any people breaking the law, attacking buildings, people, or our officers”.
He then warned, “We're up for it and we're up to it”.
The Times cited a posting on a police Internet forum where one officer spoke of “going up against the scum of our society, the immature thrill seekers and anonymous cowards who hide in large crowds with scarves pulled over their faces chanting meaningless slogans to hurl whatever is at hand at the lines of police deployed to maintain order. So boys and girls, keep your chin straps tight, your batons ready and shields high”.
The name given to the police operation—Glencoe—refers to a Highland massacre in Scotland that occurred in 1692 in which 78 people are said to have died.
Such a vast operation was utilised not in response to an “unprecedented” scale of protest but against a few thousand people who attended the demonstrations on April 1 and 2.
An article by Financial Times journalist Matthew Engel on April 1 reported his impressions of the police brutality outside the Bank of England. Several thousand protesters were hemmed in and held without food, drink or access to a toilet for hours. Anyone who tried to leave was asked for their name and address and required to have a photo taken by the police. Those who refused were forced back into the pen.
Engel said, “There were thousands of people outside the bank. The mood was emphatically not—repeat not—threatening. I have felt more threatened in a primary school playground”. He added, “The crowd was young, good-humoured and happy to be there”.
The “mood changed” when there were “reports of the attack on the RBS building, which apparently involved about 20 people, or about 0.1 per cent of those present. Immediately, the police decided to make themselves the centre of attention. They emerged in full Robocop gear”.
In the Times April 3, Tom Whipple said of the operation, “Most of all, it is the story of how the police wilfully criminalised and alienated 4,000 innocent people”.
He had initially opposed the view of one protester who had said the police are “here for a fight.” In his commentary Whipple stated, “Seven hours later—seven hours of detention without food or water—I had come to believe that I was the one who had been naive”.
The attack on two squats was also carried out as a military operation involved up to 100 riot police, armoured vehicles and door opening equipment. At the Earl Street squat near Liverpool Street Station, witnesses saw 50 to 60 riot police. According to media reports at least 80 people were taken from the squats with 4 people being charged. They were led out one by one in handcuffs before being filmed, placed against a wall, searched and handcuffed.",correct
