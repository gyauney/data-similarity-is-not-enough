Sentence: ई.पू. के आसपास, प्रारम्भिक राजवंशीय अवधि में, प्रथम राजवंशीय फैरोओं ने मेम्फिस में राजधानी की स्थापना करते हुए निचले मिस्र पर अपने नियंत्रण को मज़बूत किया, जहाँ से वे श्रम शक्ति और उर्वर डेल्टा क्षेत्र की कृषि के साथ-साथ लेवांट के लाभदायक और महत्वपूर्ण व्यापार मार्ग पर नियंत्रण रख सकते थे। प्रारम्भिक राजवंशीय काल के दौरान फ़ैरोओं की बढ़ती ताकत और संपत्ति की झलक अबिडोस में उनके विस्तृत मस्तबा कब्रों और मुर्दाघरों से दिखती है, जिसका प्रयोग मृत्यु के बाद फ़ैरो के देवत्व प्राप्ति का जश्न मनाने के लिए किया जाता था। फ़ैरोओं द्वारा विकसित शासन की मजबूत संस्था ने भूमि, श्रम और उन संसाधनों पर राज्य के नियंत्रण को वैध ठहराने का काम किया, जो मिस्र की प्राचीन सभ्यता के अस्तित्व और विकास के लिए आवश्यक थी।

MTB می‌تواند در برابر مواد ضد عفونی‌کننده ضعیف مقاومت کند و می‌تواند در یک شرایط خشک هفته‌ها زنده بماند. در طبیعت، باکتری تنها می‌تواند در داخل سلول یک ارگانیسم میزبان رشد کند، اما «M. tuberculosis» می‌توان در آزمایشگاه کشت شود.' question: 'چه چیزهایی باعث بیماری سل می شود؟'
